All AAG GSE is required to have a safety evaluation conducted prior to placing new or modified \\nGSE into use. Normal maintenance is not considered GSE modification and does not require an \\nevaluation. \\n1. Modified GSE is considered to be GSE which has received a structural or functional \\noverhaul, functional modification, or design change.\\n2. New GSE is considered any GSE that is purchased, manufactured specifically for Alaska \\nAirlines/Horizon Air, designed and manufactured by the Company or used GSE purchased \\nby AAG.\\n3. See CSM Volume 8 for specific GSE procedures.\\nB. Once a specific type of equipment has been approved, all future purchases of the same type of \\nequipment will be considered approved by Safety and does not need to be reviewed again.\\n1.5.3 Review Team\\nA. A Review Team is established to perform an evaluation of any modified GSE as described \\nabove. The team or alternates should be involved in the planning phases of GSE modification or \\nnew GSE purchases.\\nB. The most critical team members are the personnel using or working with the new/modified GSE.\\nC. Team members will include at a minimum:\\n1. One member of the respective Airline/Division modifying the equipment:\\na. Alaska Airlines GSE\\nb. Horizon Air Stations\\nc. Horizon Air Maintenance\\n2. All of the following:\\na.

This chapter includes Alaska Air Group (AAG) and management regarding safety issues, \\nincidents and accidents.\\nB. All employees are encouraged to participate in these programs to ensure issues are recognized \\nand addressed in a timely manner.\\n5.2 Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program (VDRP)\\n5.2.1 Overview\\nA. The purpose of this section is to provide a high-level overview of requirements for participating in \\nthe Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program (VDRP). The VDRP allows the Company to report \\nan apparent regulatory violation to the FAA without civil penalties being imposed; however, there \\nare several caveats for this to be allowed.\\nNOTE\\nRefer to the most current version of AC 00-58, Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program for \\nadditional details regarding voluntary disclosures.\\nNOTE\\nVoluntary disclosure violations of 49 CFR Part 175 should be accomplished in accordance with \\nthe most current version of AC 121-37, Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program-Hazardous \\nMaterials.\\nB. The procedures outlined in this section are a high level overview of requirements if an apparent \\nviolation of a regulation occurs. Detailed steps, by department, are located in the division\\'s \\nrespective manuals. \\nC. These procedures do not apply to those persons who are required to report failures, \\nmalfunctions, and defects under 14 CFR Part 21 (21.3) and who do not make those reports in \\nthe timeframe required by the regulations.\\nD. For a voluntary disclosure to be submitted, it is important to contact one of the following:\\n1. Alaska Airlines:\\na. Flight Operations: Director, Flight Operations, Regulatory Compliance\\nb. Inflight: Director, Inflight, Regulatory Compliance\\nc. Airport Operations and Customer Service: Manager, FAA Liaison Ground Operations, \\nRegulatory Compliance\\nd. Maintenance: Manager, Regulatory Compliance, Quality AssuranceRev. 1-2023\\n6/16/20232 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\ne. Hazardous Materials: Manager, Dangerous Goods, Regulatory Compliance\\nf. Anti-Drug and Alcohol: Director, Human Resource (HR) Systems and Compliance, HR \\nCompliance\\n2. Horizon Air\\na. Flight Operations: Director, Flight Operations, Regulatory Compliance\\nb. Inflight: Director, Inflight, Regulatory Compliance\\nc. Airport Operations and Customer Service: Manager, FAA Liaison Ground Operations, \\nRegulatory Compliance\\nd. Maintenance: Manager, FAA Liaison and Maintenance Program Manager\\ne. Hazardous Materials: Manager, Dangerous Goods, Regulatory Compliance\\nf. Anti-Drug and Alcohol: Manager, Drug Abatement\\nE. If a repeated violation occurs and with consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding \\nthe repeated violation, the FAA will determine on a case-by-case basis whether a repeated \\nviolation will be covered under this policy.\\nF. If a VDRP is driven from one of the safety reporting programs, confidentiality will be maintained, \\nexcept when a willful disregard for safety is determined.\\nG. All voluntary disclosures will be entered into the FAA web-based VDRP system, which requires \\nlogin identification and a password.\\nH. The VDRP User Guide can be found at: https://av-info.faa.gov/VDRP/UserGuide.pdf. Additional \\nassistance may be obtained via telephone from the VDRP Help Desk at (866) 285-4942.\\n5.2.2 Violation Evaluation\\nA. To ensure an apparent violation is covered by the policy, the following conditions must be met:\\n1. The Company has notified the FAA of the apparent violation immediately after detecting it \\nand before the FAA has learned of it by other means.\\na. Exceptions—Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) Report. If the FAA has learned of \\nan apparent violation by a certificate holder from an ASAP report as described in the \\ncurrent edition of AC 120-66, Aviation Safety Action Program, a voluntary disclosure \\ncan still be accepted by the FAA, even though the FAA has already learned of the \\nviolation from the ASAP.\\nb. Exceptions—Joint Audit. Similarly, if a regulated entity voluntarily agrees to conduct a \\njoint audit (inspection) with the FAA during which an apparent violation is discovered \\neither by the company or FAA members of the audit (inspection) team, the FAA may \\naccept a voluntary disclosure submitted by the company, even though the FAA has \\nalready learned of the apparent violation during the course of the joint audit \\n(inspection). This exception is further addressed in the “Transparency MOU” where the \\nFAA and Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air Industries have established procedures for \\naddressing safety and non-compliance issues discovered through evaluating real-time Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/20233 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\noperational data and participation in safety data sharing meetings. Safety and non-\\ncompliance issues discovered through real-time operational data and participation in \\nsafety data sharing meetings are eligible for VDRP as joint audit.\\n1) To view the current Alaska Airlines VDRP MOU (Transparency Agreement), click \\nhere.\\n2) To view the current Horizon Air VDRP MOU (Transparency Agreement), click here.\\n2. The apparent violation was inadvertent.\\n3. The apparent violation does not indicate a lack, or reasonable question, of qualification by \\nthe Company.\\n4. Immediate action, satisfactory to the FAA, was taken upon discovery to terminate the \\nconduct that resulted in the apparent violation.\\n5. The Company developed or is developing a comprehensive fix and schedule of \\nimplementation satisfactory to the FAA; this includes:\\na. A follow-up self-audit to ensure that the action taken corrects the noncompliance\\nb. The self-audit is in addition to any audits conducted by the FAA.\\n5.2.3 Six Stages of a VDRP\\nA. Stages are successive in the VDRP system. Responsibility for each of the six stages is assigned \\neither to the Company or the FAA. \\nB. The Company is required to use the web-based VDRP system for submitting voluntary \\ndisclosures to the FAA unless extenuating circumstances prevent initial notification.\\nC. When acceptable to the Principal Inspector (PI), initial notice of a voluntary disclosure may be \\nsubmitted via other means provided the Company enters the initial notification data via the web-\\nbased VDRP system within 72 hours of the original notification. Other means include:\\n1. Oral \\n2. Written (hardcopy) \\n3. Electronic (email)\\nD. Compliance with the 10 or 30-day limit for submission of the written report, as described in Stage \\nIII below, will be based on the date of the original notification, regardless of the submission \\nmeans or media.\\nE. The initial notification of a voluntary disclosure must be submitted by a management official \\nspecified in 14 CFR Part 119 (119.65 or 119.69) or an employee authorized by the Company. If \\nan authorized employee submits the voluntary disclosure, a letter signed by the management \\nofficial specified in 14 CFR Part 119 (119.65 or 119.69) and include:\\n1. The corporate official is aware of the disclosure,\\n2. The Company took immediate action to cease the apparent violation activity, and Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/20234 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n3. The Company has or is developing a comprehensive fix for FAA consideration that includes \\nself-audits.\\nF. Stage I: Notification \\n1. Initial notification of the apparent violation via the web-based VDRP system automatically \\nnotifies the PI. If the voluntary disclosure is provided via other means, direct contact must \\nbe made with the appropriate PI. \\n2. The following items should be included in the report:\\na. A brief description of the apparent violation, the estimate of how long it remained \\nundetected, and when it was discovered.\\nb. Verification the non-compliance ceased.\\nc. A brief description of the immediate action taken after the apparent violation was \\nidentified, what action(s) terminated the conduct, and the person responsible for taking \\nimmediate action.\\nd. Verification an evaluation is underway to determine if there are systemic problems and \\ncorrective steps to prevent recurrence.Name of the person responsible for preparing \\nthe comprehensive fix.\\ne. Confirmation that a written report will be provided to the PI within 10 working-days.\\nG. Stage II: FAA Response \\n1. The PI will review the submission and respond confirming the submission meets the \\nfollowing requirements:\\na. Notification was received by the FAA immediately after detecting the apparent violation, \\nand before the FAA learned of if by other means.\\nb. The apparent violation was inadvertent.\\nc. The apparent violation does not indicate a lack, or reasonable question, of qualification \\nby the Company.\\nd. Immediate action was taken to terminate the conduct resulting in the apparent violation.\\ne. The Company developed, or is developing, a comprehensive fix and implementation \\nschedule.\\nf. The initial notification was submitted properly.\\n2. Once the PI has completed the review, the determination is made to accept, return for edit, \\nor reject the voluntary disclosure. \\na. Acceptance: If the PI accepts the disclosure, the PI completes the required Stage II \\nentries and it is forwarded to the FAA Office Manager. \\nb. Return for Edit: If the PI finds the disclosure does not contain sufficient information to \\naccept the disclosure, the PI has the option of returning the disclosure to the Company \\nfor editing. The VDRP system notifies the Company of the determination via email and \\nreturns the case to Stage I, pending resubmission.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/20235 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nc. Rejection/Invalid: If the PI finds the disclosure does not meet the requirements or it has \\nbeen determined that no violation occurred, the Company is notified via email. When \\nfound to be invalid, the case is not assigned an Enforcement Investigative Report (EIR) \\nnumber.\\n3. The FAA Office Manager will review the PI\\'s comments. \\na. If concurrence, entries will be made to assign the submission an EIR number and move \\nthe voluntary disclosure to Stage III.\\nb. If non-concurrence, the submission will be referred back the PI for further review/\\naction.\\nH. Stage III: Written Report by the Company\\n1. The written report should be submitted via the web-based VDRP system within 10 working-\\ndays from the date the disclosure was submitted. The report must contain:\\na. A detailed description of the proposed comprehensive fix, outlining the planned \\ncorrective steps\\nb. The responsibilities for implementing those corrective steps\\nc. A time schedule for completion of the fix\\nNOTE\\nIf a proposed comprehensive fix is not fully developed within 10 working-days from the \\ndate the disclosure was submitted to the FAA, the Company should provide an \\noverview of its comprehensive fix plans. A final plan should be submitted to the FAA \\nwithin 30 calendar-days after initial notification.\\n2. The written report should include:\\na. A list of the specific FAA regulations that may have been violated.\\nb. A description of the apparent violation, including the duration of time it remained \\nundetected, as well as how and when it was detected.\\nc. A description of the immediate action taken to stop the conduct that resulted in the \\napparent violation; including when it was taken, and who was responsible for taking the \\naction.\\nd. An explanation that shows the apparent violation was inadvertent.\\ne. Evidence demonstrating the seriousness of the apparent violation and the Company\\'s \\nanalysis of that evidence.\\nf. Completion of the Risk Assessment to aid in evaluating the significance of the event. \\ng. A detailed description of the proposed comprehensive fix, outlining the planned \\ncorrective steps, the responsibilities for implementing those corrective steps, and a \\ntime schedule for completion of the fix and the subsequent self-audit.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/20236 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nh. Identification of the company official(s) responsible for monitoring the implementation \\nand completion of the comprehensive fix, and the self-audit.\\nI. Stage IV: Written Review by the FAA\\n1. The FAA will work with the Company to ensure root causes and potential systemic issues \\nare identified. Additionally, the PI is also tasked with completing a Risk Assessment to aid in \\nevaluating the significance of the event and the proposed comprehensive fix. This \\ncollaboration helps to ensure that the corrective actions contained in the comprehensive fix \\nare acceptable to the FAA.\\nNOTE\\nIf the investigation of the apparent violation determines that no violation occurred, the EIR \\nmay be closed by rescinding the file and providing an explanation in the web-based VDRP. \\nAt this point the file will be closed and the investigation terminated. \\nNOTE\\nStage V: Implementation of the Comprehensive Fix and FAA Surveillance\\n2. During the implementation period, the FAA may advise and assist the Company in \\ncorrecting any identified systemic problems. Changes to the proposed comprehensive fix \\nwill be made as needed. When the proposed comprehensive fix is satisfactory, the PI can \\nissue a letter of correction. If the letter of correction is issued in Stage V, and subsequent \\nchanges are made to the Comprehensive Fix, the PI shall issue and upload a revised letter \\nof correction in Stage VI which reflects the letter of correction as implemented.\\n3. Throughout the implementation period, the FAA will assess the regulated corrective efforts \\nand top management\\'s awareness of these efforts. If, during this period, the FAA \\ndetermines the steps taken are not those documented in the comprehensive fix and \\nacceptable corrective action, the letter of correction may be rescinded. In this case, \\nappropriate legal enforcement action can be initiated.\\nJ. Stage VI: Inspector Signoff\\n1. At the conclusion of the implementation period, the PI and the FAA Office Manager will \\nmake a final assessment. \\na. If all elements of the comprehensive fix are satisfactorily accomplished, including the \\nCompany\\'s self-audit, the PI will make the required entries for Stage VI completion.\\nb. Upon Stage VI submission the FAA Office Manager will then review the VDRP file and \\nassess the adequacy of the comprehensive fix. \\n1) If the FAA Office Manager concurs, Stage VI is concluded. The web-based VDRP \\nsystem will automatically generate the Form 2150-5 and close the associated EIR \\nrecord.\\n2) If the FAA Office Manager does not concur, comments will be provided and refer \\nthe EIR back to the PI for further review.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/20237 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n5.3 Safety Recommendations\\nA. In order to provide a method to control and manage required actions, a system much like the \\nNTSB’s recommendation process has been developed at AAG. It is anticipated there will be \\nsafety related issues discovered in the course of audits, evaluations, drills and investigations (or \\nby other means such as employee reports) that require corrective action. This section provides \\nhow Safety Recommendations will be developed, presented and tracked.\\nB. Safety related issues, of an urgent nature, which require immediate corrective action in order to \\navoid injury, damage or non-compliance with regulations, will be communicated directly to the \\ndivision head immediately.\\n5.3.1 Sources\\nA.

The internal audit process is stated below. There are five processes:\\n1. Audit Planning\\n2. ISM Revisions\\n3. Auditor Training\\n4. Internal IOSA Audit\\n5. Input into electronic database\\nB. The Company audit teams should follow the established timeline to ensure an on time \\ncompletion of the internal audit process.\\n1. Audit Planning: Audit planning will be performed before the start of each internal IOSA audit \\nwith the purposes of identifying all necessary resources. Divisions should integrate internal \\naudit of ISARPs within the quality assurance audit schedule.\\n2. ISM Revision: IATA publishes a new ISM every year. New standards and recommended \\npractices are introduced within every revision which shall be incorporated into the IOSA \\naudit process.\\n3. Auditor Training: Internal Auditors must attend refresher IOSA auditor training prior to \\nperforming any audit activities as documented in this section.\\n4. Internal IOSA Audit: Auditors shall follow procedures and methodologies as documented in \\nthis section.\\n5. Entries into the electronic database: Divisional points of contact (POC) shall complete the \\nfollowing procedures:\\na. Alpha-numeric Identifier; included in CR Template.\\nb. List of all controlled documents used during the auditing of the ISARPs.\\nc. Name of Auditor; List names of auditor(s) that conducted the assessment.\\nd. Date of Audit; List the date of the latest assessment.\\ne. Auditor Actions (AA); use the numbered columns for the AAs which were \\naccomplished. If an ISARP is not applicable (N/A), the AAs do not need to be used.\\nf. If applicable, description of non-conformity:\\n1) Clear, accurate description of non-conformity.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202316 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n2) Description of root cause(s): The factual, objective reason why a specification was \\nnot active or had not been implemented. Generalized phrases or brief statements \\nsuch as “ISARP not considered” are not appropriate.\\n3) If already corrected, record the corrective action taken to permanently close the \\nfinding or observation.\\ng. If applicable, description of N/A; A reason must be provided for all ISARPs assessed as \\nN/A.\\nh. Status of Conformity; list the current status of the assessment: conformity, open finding \\nor observation, or assessment of N/A.\\nC. Assessing Documentation\\n1. Identify the manuals and/or other document(s) that contain the information relevant to the \\nspecification(s) in the particular ISARP. It is a fundamental principle of IOSA that the \\nrelevant information must be contained in a controlled document.\\n2. The manuals and/or documents being assessed must be available for use by all the staff \\nand/or crews involved.\\n3. The references for documents or manuals must include an edition or revision number, and/\\nor a date of issue, or other means of recording traceability of the information.\\n4. Manuals and/or documents of a temporary or transitory nature (e.g., letters, emails, memos, \\nflyers, posters, PowerPoint presentations, etc.) are not controlled documents.\\n5. If the ISARP covers a broad range of procedures and there are documentary references \\nfrom the majority of the sections of a manual, a generalized reference can be used, (i.e., a \\nphrase such as “GOM – entire manual” or “OMA – all sections”).\\n6. Confirming the process, procedure, etc., is documented is not sufficient, the content must \\nbe assessed, to confirm that all elements of the ISARP requirement have been addressed.\\nD. Assessing Implementation\\n1. The auditor needs to become familiar with the controlled document(s) containing the \\nspecific system, plan, policy, process or procedure being assessed.\\n2. Evidence must then be identified to confirm that the specification(s) is/are being used on a \\nday-to-day basis by the personnel or crew concerned, in accordance with the documented \\nrequirement.\\n3. The AAs provide specific information on the actions that would be conventionally used to \\nconfirm implementation for that ISARP. If local circumstances result in different actions \\nbeing needed to confirm implementation, these actions should be recorded in the CR, under \\nthe last listed AA, Other Actions.\\nE. Identifying ISARPs that are Not Applicable\\n1. An N/A assessment can only be used if the process, function, equipment requirement, etc., \\nis completely inactive, or does not apply to any part of the operator\\'s system.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202317 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n2. Descriptions for N/A assessments must be clear, complete and not contradict other \\nassessments.\\n3. Sub-specifications not applicable (usually referred to as mini N/As ) to the operator must be \\nindependently assessed as N/A, irrespective of whether the ISARP is in conformity or not.\\n4. An N/A assessment cannot be used for active outsourced functions; verification of \\nadequate oversight must be checked.\\n5. N/A assessments are not required when:\\na. A function is listed within a sentence;\\nb. A sub-specification is contained in a Table; or\\nc. A sub-specification is separated by an ‘or’.\\nF. Assessing Systemic Applicability of ISARPs\\n1. The assessment under the quality assurance program must ensure that the Operator\\'s \\nprocess takes into account all stations and locations; however, the Operator does not have \\nto audit all stations in the network. The Operator would typically monitor the conformity with \\nthe ISARPs in the whole network and collect necessary information to assess the relevant \\nISARPs. The assessment of one single ISARP represents the conformity status of all \\napplicable stations, processes, fleets, etc.\\n2. This will typically include a combination of primary auditing (the home base) and the \\nchecking of audits (oversight) of the other stations in the network.\\nG. Assessing Outsourced Functions\\n1. The activity or function being provided by the third party must be assessed or monitored, to \\nensure that all safety and security requirements are being met.\\n2. The oversight of outsourced functions and/or services by the Operator must include all \\nstations and locations used by the Operator at which the function(s) are active.\\n3. Auditing of outsourced functions is the recommended method of monitoring (repeated in the \\nother disciplines), but other methods of oversight can be used.\\n4. What is important is that the method of monitoring the outsourced function is effective and \\nensures that all safety and security requirements are being satisfied.\\nH. Auditor Actions Published by IATA (www.iata.org/iosa)\\n1. First AA identification and review of the documentation requirement.\\n2. Second AA interview with the responsible Manager(s), for a description of the function, \\nactivity, process or procedure, etc.\\n3. Follow-on AA(s) are an AA or group of AAs used to check physical implementation of the \\nfunction or activity specifically for that ISARP.\\n4. Last AA used to describe additional action(s) which are not listed.\\nI. Using the AAs Published by IATARev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202318 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n1. Review the ISARP and the AAs, to gain an understanding of what actions will be needed to \\nassess documentation and implementation.\\n2. Once the controlled documentation has been identified, use the interview with the \\nresponsible manager to identify the process flow and functionality.\\n3. Pay particular attention to the follow-on AAs (c), the actions needed to confirm \\nimplementation of the ISARP requirement.\\n4. The last AA, Other Actions, should be used describe AAs that either were substituted or \\nadded to the AAs that were published for that particular ISARP.\\nJ. Auditing ISARPs with a Parallel Conformity Option\\n1. The auditor must review between the options and assess which is applicable to the \\noperation.\\n2. The primary specification(s) and the PCO are separated by the words “or”, “either”, “one or \\nmore”, “any one of the following”, to indicate the alternative option.\\n3. Once the applicable option has been identified, the other options can be ignored.\\n4. Evidence must then be found to support conformity with the applicable option.\\nK. Auditing SMS ISARPs with Linked Assessments\\n1. ORG SMS ISARPs must be assessed as non-conformity when the corresponding repeat \\nISARP has been assessed as a non-conformity.\\nL. Identifying and Recording the Root Cause\\n1. To identify the permanent corrective action needed, and to prevent the problem from \\nrecurring, the primary root cause for the non-conformity has to be identified.\\na. Identify the reasons and evidence that resulted in the Findings or Observation.\\nb. Analyze why the system, program, policy, process, procedure, plan, or other ISARP \\nspecification, had not been incorporated.\\nc. The analysis should identify all the factors which led to the problem, but must focus on \\nidentifying the fundamental reasons that the specification had not been introduced.\\nM. Recording of Non-conformities\\n1. Identify which specifications (and/or sub specifications) in the ISARP are not in conformity.\\n2. Identify which specifications in the ISARP are not documented.\\n3. Identify which specifications in the ISARP are not implemented.\\n4. Describe the non-conformity in simple, factual terms that will be easily understood by any \\nreviewer. This will ensure that all personnel/airline departments involved implement \\nappropriate and permanent corrective actions.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202319 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nFigure 5-1: Recommended IOSA Registration Renewal Timeline\\n5.8.6 Controls\\nA.

The Director, Safety Assurance, \\nis responsible for requesting and monitoring the IOSA audit status of all CPA partners and \\ncoordinating on-site audits for non-IOSA CPA partners. Non-IOSA partners shall have an \\nonsite visit at a minimum every two years.\\n5.10 Foreign Code Share\\n5.10.1 Code Share Operational Review Program\\nA. Overview\\n1. Revisions to these policies and procedures will require the approval of the VP, Safety& \\nSecurity and the Chief Compliance Officer with the concurrence of the Horizon Air \\nManaging Director, Safety.\\n2. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (DBA Horizon Air) are wholly owned \\nsubsidiaries of Alaska Air Group, Inc., and as such, the two carriers integrate their flight \\nschedules to provide the best possible service between any two points served by their \\nsystems. All flights operated by the two carriers do so under the AS (Alaska Airlines) \\ndesignator code (Horizon does not currently market flights under its QX designator code). \\nThe provisions of this program apply to both Alaska Airlines. Inc (hereafter referred to as \\nAlaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (hereafter referred to as Horizon). Alaska and \\nHorizon may engage in code share agreements with foreign air carriers throughout the \\nworld to strengthen and expand their market presence and competitive ability.\\n3. In August of 1999 the Department of Defense and the Air Transport Association entered \\ninto a Memorandum of Understanding regarding code share services of U.S. airlines on \\nforeign air carriers that transport DOD personnel. Based on that MOU, Alaska has \\ndeveloped a process to review the operation of foreign air carriers. The process has been \\nenhanced by the Department of Transportation Code Share Safety Program guidelines \\npublished on February 29, 2000.\\n4. The following guidelines identify the minimum necessary elements Alaska will use when \\nconducting a Code Share Operational Review (CSOR) on a foreign air carrier. The CSOR \\nwill be based upon the ATA developed standards, augmented by Alaska, as well as \\ndocumentation procedures prescribed by DOT. Regardless of whether the proposed \\nForeign Code Share relationship is with Alaska, Horizon or both carriers, the Code Share \\nOperational Review will be conducted by qualified Alaska personnel.\\nB. Program\\n1. Methodology and Approach\\na. Objective: The objective of the Alaska Code Share Operational Review (CSOR) \\nprogram is to determine, through periodic reviews, using DOT code share safety Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202322 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nprogram guidelines, that existing and proposed foreign code share carriers have the \\nprocesses in place that are: (1) in accordance with defined industry standards, and (2) \\nnecessary for the execution of sustained flight operations.\\nb. Scope: To review the operation of all existing and proposed foreign code share carriers \\nworldwide, consistent with restrictions as outlined in the introduction of the DOT code \\nshare safety program guidelines. Reviews are conducted on-site a minimum of once \\nevery 24 months by a team of trained area experts normally over a duration of 3-5 \\ndays.\\n2. Specific Operational Areas to be Reviewed: Reviews are to be conducted using evaluation \\nstandards developed by the airline membership of the Air Transport Association. These \\nstandards include criteria from the following:\\na. ICAO Standards (Annex 1, 6, 8, 13)\\nb. DOD Guidelines\\nc. FAR 129\\nd. Best Practices\\ne. Operational areas to be reviewed include:\\n1) Cabin Operations\\n2) Dangerous Goods\\n3) Flight Dispatch\\n4) Flight Operations\\n5) Flight Safety\\n6) Ground Handling\\n7) Technical Operations (Maintenance and Engineering)\\n8) Security\\n3. In preparation for a review, the evaluating team will have been fully briefed on the foreign air \\ncarrier’s operations utilizing information gained from past reports and/or internal \\ninvestigations.\\n4. Checklists: Evaluators will use standard checklists developed in conjunction with other Air \\nTransport Association (ATA) carriers, approved by the Department of Defense and the \\nDepartment of Transportation. These checklists will be based upon evaluation standards \\nand will cover operational areas as detailed above.\\n5. Criteria for Determining Satisfactory Review Results: Evaluators will review the standards \\nagainst those criteria specified in the aforementioned standards, using the following \\ndefinitions:\\na. Meets the criteria: Foreign air carrier meets the standard and/or guideline without \\nsafety deficiencies or findings.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202323 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nb. Finding: Foreign air carrier performance of the standard evaluated does not meet the \\nestablished criteria.\\nc. Criteria not in use: The evaluation reveals a specific condition as applicable by the \\nstandard, the condition is not in place, but future implementation is likely.\\nd. Not applicable: The evaluation reveals a specific condition is not applicable by the \\nstandard.\\n6. System for Reporting and Correcting Findings: The Operational Review will ensure the \\nforeign air carrier has a process in place that identifies and trends deficiencies. Corrective \\nAction Requests (CARs) will be issued to analyze, document and determine the root cause \\nof the finding and to prevent repetition. The CAR is designed to identify:\\na. The need for short and long term action\\nb. The changes required in the process, product, and specifications\\nc. The designated operational area responsible for follow-up\\nd. The effectiveness of the corrective action taken to meet the standard\\n7. Process: Upon completion of a Code Share Operational Review, all checklists and working \\npapers will be reviewed by Alaska Corporate Safety, and any findings will be entered into \\nthe Code Share Operational Review Findings Tracking Tool (Safety Manual Section). This \\ntracking tool will be sent to the foreign airline as part of the report detailing the outcome of \\nthe audit. Corrective Action Requests will be given a planned completion date no later than \\n30 days from the date of issue. The Alaska Safety Division will follow up with the \\nappropriate personnel from the foreign carrier to assure that Corrective Action Requests are \\ncompleted, and that systems are in place to prevent recurrence of the findings.\\nNOTE\\nNOTE 1: Findings will be assigned a tracking number based on the department involved, e.g. Flight \\nOperations findings will be listed as FO1, FO2, FO3, etc.Table 5-2: Code Share Operational Review Findings Tracking Tool\\nAIRLINE REVIEWED: DATE OF REVIEW:\\nItem \\n#Finding Responsible \\nPartyCorrective \\nAction RequestPlan Date Completion \\nDateRev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202324 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nNOTE 2: The findings themselves will be listed, including the specific reference by ICAO standards, \\nDOD or DOT guidelines, or Federal Aviation Regulations.\\nNOTE 3: The responsible party is that representative of the Foreign Airline who is charged with \\ncorrecting the finding and reporting the completion of the action.\\nNOTE 4: The Corrective Action Request is that specific action which must be taken by the Foreign \\nAirline to correct the finding.\\nNOTE 5: Plan Date is that date by which the implementation of the Corrective Action is expected to \\nbe completed.\\nNOTE 6: Completion Date is that date upon which the Corrective Action is actually completed.\\n8.

Interface and cooperation between the U.S. and foreign air carriers, familiarity with \\npersonnel, sharing of data through meetings, conferences, etc. as well as the \\nfrequency of these events\\ni. Foreign code share carrier facilities\\n9. Process: The VP, Safety & Security will be responsible for assuring that the foreign carriers \\nare monitored on an ongoing basis. Each six months following the original review, a desktop \\nreview of the foreign code share partner will be performed by a qualified Operational \\nReview Evaluator. This desktop review will be conducted using the process flow and risk \\nassessment tool contained in Addendum 1 of this section. This monitoring will include direct \\ncommunication with the foreign carrier, the review of aviation news sources, reports from \\nother carriers and regulatory agencies (including code share agreements with carriers other \\nthan Alaska), reports from aircraft manufacturers and lessors, information from statistical \\nand financial databases, and any and all other sources generally available to major airline \\nmanagement. In the event that certain aspects of the monitoring process are delegated to \\nthe audit team members according to their individual areas of expertise, these delegates \\nwill report any negative finding regarding the monitored airline immediately to The VP, \\nSafety & Security. Any finding will be communicated directly to the foreign carrier for \\nresponse, explanation, and corrective action as required.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202325 of 43\\nChapter 5Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n10.

AAG owns and leases multiple facilities that are occupied by employees, customers, and/or \\ncontract service providers. This policy will provide information and education to affected \\nemployees or contract service providers about the hazards of asbestos-containing material, how \\nto identify such material, and what actions to take to protect the safety of all facility occupants \\nfollowing contact with such material. This policy will also assist in meeting compliance with state \\nand federal regulations as they pertain to asbestos.\\n6.4.1 Responsibility and Authority\\nA. The VP, Safety & Security is responsible for the implementation and the quality of the Asbestos \\nManagement Program.\\nB. The Managing Director, Safety Programs has the authority to establish and modify this plan.\\n6.4.2 General Information\\nA. Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral fiber that has been used in building products in the \\npast. Although its use in construction materials has been largely discontinued, it was used in \\nsome materials into the late 1980’s. It is commonly found in heating system insulation, spray-on \\nceiling treatments (such as popcorn ceilings), vinyl flooring (such as sheet vinyl and tiles) and \\nadhesives, cement shake siding, and a wide variety of other materials.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202318 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nB. Airborne asbestos is a recognized health hazard. When disturbed, asbestos breaks down into \\nfibers up to 1,200 times thinner than a human hair. When inhaled, they can become embedded \\nin lung tissues. Medical research indicates that up to 30 years after inhalation, asbestos fibers \\ncan cause lung cancer or other lung-related cancers. State and federal occupational safety and \\nhealth authorities regulate activities involving asbestos-containing materials. Most new building \\nproducts are asbestos-free. Concerns usually only arise during demolition and remodeling of \\nexisting facilities.\\nC. Although a building owner/lessee must follow proper procedures and use appropriately licensed \\npersons to manage asbestos, the mere presence of asbestos does not require removal, or any \\nother treatment, unless the asbestos is damaged or is in an area where damage may occur. The \\nasbestos-containing material (ACM) 1 must be addressed when demolition, renovation or \\noperations and maintenance procedures occur, or the condition of the ACM deteriorates to the \\npoint of posing a health risk. Asbestos-containing Material (ACM) is any material that has been \\ndetermined by laboratory testing to contain at least 1% asbestos. Any material must be \\nconsidered as ACM unless specifically tested.\\nD. The building owner has the primary responsibility for the presence, condition, disturbance, \\nrenovation, demolition, and disposal of any asbestos-containing material encountered at that \\nbuilding or facility. The building lessee also has responsibility for asbestos where the lessee \\nexercises control over the management and record keeping functions of the building. This policy \\napplies to those buildings and structures that are owned and/or maintained by AAG.\\n6.4.2.1 Department Responsibilities\\nA. Safety Programs is responsible for all health and safety aspects of asbestos activities, including \\nemployee notification, employee training, and exposure monitoring. Safety Programs will \\nprovide information to employees involved in asbestos-related activities and will serve as the \\nliaison with state and federal occupational safety and health authorities.\\n6.4.2.2 Corporate Real Estate\\nA. Corporate Real Estate is responsible for coordinating all asbestos-related regulatory and policy \\nrequirements prior to starting any Facilities projects. This shall include review of building surveys \\nwhere available and notification to Environmental Affairs when building surveys are not \\navailable. When starting a project in a building where ACM has been found, Safety Programs \\nwill be notified. Corporate Real Estate will be responsible for coordinating all asbestos \\nabatement projects, including notifying Airport Operations Safety and Environmental Affairs prior \\nto the start of any work, utilizing only certified asbestos workers, informing all contractors of the \\npresence of asbestos within their work areas, and developing asbestos operations and \\nmaintenance programs should they become necessary. Corporate Real Estate will be \\nresponsible for ensuring that materials used during construction, remodel or maintenance work \\nare asbestos-free. An Environmental Checklist for Facilities Projects shall be submitted to \\nEnvironmental Affairs for each construction, demolition, or renovation project to ensure all \\nAsbestos Program elements are followed.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202319 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.4.2.3 Environmental Affairs\\nA. The role of Environmental Affairs is to assist the various departments complying with the \\napplicable environmental regulations. When outside environmental contractors are retained for \\ncapital projects involving asbestos, Environmental Affairs shall provide technical review and \\nguidance to Corporate Real Estate project managers. Environmental Affairs shall be responsible \\nfor obtaining asbestos survey reports and correspondence with environmental regulatory \\nagencies as it relates to asbestos projects. The Environmental Affairs department will maintain \\nthe aggregate survey database accessible by the Corporate Real Estate Department.\\n6.4.3 Communication of Asbestos-Related Activities\\nA. Notification to Environmental Affairs: Since some AS buildings were constructed prior to 1980, \\nACM may be present and may be impacted during HVAC, structural, and other renovation \\nprojects. All projects and other events that may involve asbestos shall be reported directly to \\nEnvironmental Affairs as soon as feasible prior to disturbing or handling asbestos.\\nB. Examples of such situations are the following:\\n1. Maintenance projects (plumbing and HVAC)\\n2. General construction and renovation\\n3. Emergency pipe breaks and floods\\n4. Electrical work above suspended ceilings\\n5. Any work in mechanical equipment areas\\n6. Building demolition\\n7. When the following materials/building components at any AS facility may potentially be \\nimpacted, Environmental Affairs shall be notified:\\na. Thermal system insulation including pipe insulation, boiler jackets, etc.\\nb. Trowelled-on wall and ceiling plaster\\nc. Acoustical ceilings\\nd. Floor tiles/rolled linoleum\\ne. Fixed ceiling tiles\\nf. Spray-on fireproofing\\ng. Roofing (field and flashing)Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202320 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.4.4 Employee Notification\\nA. For scheduled maintenance and construction projects involving asbestos abatement work, all \\nbuilding occupants potentially affected shall be notified in writing ten days prior to the onset of \\nabatement work. The results for all air sampling and analysis events shall on-file at the Airport \\nOperations Safety office and available for review. Copies of final clearance air sampling results \\nshall be posted for employees and/or forwarded to authorized union representatives. Airport \\nOperations Safety will notify all affected building occupants following receipt of this information.\\n1. Employees in areas where ACM has been found will be notified following the discovery of \\nits presence by Airport Operations Safety. Employees at locations where initial asbestos \\nsurveys have recently been completed will also receive notification as to the presence of \\nACM. Such notices will be sent to local management for posting and filing at the location.\\n2. Emergency Notification: Since uncontrolled disturbances of ACM may potentially result in \\nthe exposure of in-house personnel and other workers to airborne asbestos, adherence to \\nthis policy is critical. In the event such an uncontrolled release occurs, emergency asbestos \\nair monitoring and on-site analysis shall be conducted immediately by the building owner or \\nan authorized representative of Airport Operations Safety. The results of such emergency \\ntesting shall be reported in writing to those persons affected and the authorized union \\nrepresentatives, if applicable. The appropriate repairs to the material will be arranged \\nthrough Corporate Real Estate and performed by certified asbestos abatement contractors.\\nNOTE\\nAny employee who comes into contact with disturbed or damaged ACM shall notify their \\nsupervisor and the Airport Operations department to ensure prompt action is taken.\\n6.4.5 Asbestos Surveys\\nA. Several activities that would typically require the Company or the building owner to perform an \\nasbestos survey. These activities are operations and maintenance, renovation, and demolition. \\nFor major construction and other projects where no previous sampling and analysis data is \\navailable, an asbestos survey/hazard assessment is required. Bulk samples shall be collected \\nand analyzed by a licensed asbestos inspector for classification as ACM or non-ACM. The \\ndocumentation for previous survey results is available for review at the Environmental Affairs \\ndepartment.\\nB. If, upon visual inspection, the ACM is found to be intact (i.e., outer covering not broken, good \\nadherence to substrate) and for non-friable materials such as floor tiles, the material is not likely \\nto pose an airborne asbestos hazard and may remain in place. Where ACM is left in place, \\nCorporate Real Estate will perform periodic (i.e., every six months) re-inspection of ACM and \\nkeep records of all inspection activities.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202321 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.4.6 Exposure Monitoring\\nA. According to OSHA regulations, all employees who have been exposed to asbestos shall be \\nnotified in writing by the building owner or responsible lessee. It should be emphasized that the \\nterm exposure, by OSHA definition, denotes encountering an elevated airborne concentration \\n(above the 0.1 fibers/cc permissible exposure limit) of a regulated substance such that inhalation \\nis possible. The mere presence of the substance in the building does not constitute an exposure \\nhazard. In the case of asbestos, under normal circumstances, only damaged ACM would \\nbecome airborne and pose an exposure hazard. While Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air are \\ncommitted to protecting all employees from an airborne exposure hazard, this does not \\nguarantee that all areas shall be deemed asbestos free.\\n6.4.7 Labeling of Accessible Asbestos-Containing Material\\nA. All accessible ACM (i.e., not enclosed above hard plaster ceilings/behind walls) shall be labeled \\nwith asbestos hazard labels such that the material may be avoided by plumbers, electricians, \\nand other in-house and contractor personnel.\\nB. In addition, asbestos warning signs must be posted at the entrance to mechanical rooms/areas \\nin which employees reasonably can be expected to enter and which contain presumed \\nasbestos-containing material (PACM). PACM can be thermal system insulation including pipe \\ninsulation and boiler jackets, trowelled-on wall and ceiling plaster, acoustical ceilings, floor tiles/\\nrolled linoleum, fixed ceiling tiles, spray-on fireproofing, roofing (field and flashing) found in \\nbuildings constructed prior to 1980 that has not been specifically surveyed for asbestos. \\nEnvironmental Affairs shall communicate to Corporate Real Estate the areas where labeling is \\nrequired based on asbestos survey results. Corporate Real Estate shall provide and install \\nlabels and placards where required.\\n6.4.8 Training\\nA. Safety Programs shall identify all Company personnel whose job duties require familiarization \\nwith asbestos-containing materials found in Company owned or occupied facilities.\\nB. Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air Facilities Maintenance, Facilities Project Managers, ICS field \\ntechnicians, custodial workers, and others whose job duties may put them in direct contact with \\nACM or PACM and any persons who oversee such work must participate in a 2-hour Asbestos \\nAwareness Training.\\nC. The training curriculum shall include, at a minimum:\\n1. Available information concerning the location of PACM, ACM, asbestos-containing flooring \\nmaterials or flooring materials where the absence of asbestos has not been certified\\n2. Instruction on how to recognize damaged, deteriorated, and delaminated of asbestos \\ncontaining building materials\\n3. Health effects of asbestos\\n4. Locations of ACM and PACM in the building/facility\\n5. Recognition of ACM and PACM damage and deteriorationRev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202322 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6. Requirements in this standard relating to housekeeping\\n7. Proper response to fiber release episodes\\n8. Attendance in refresher training is required annually\\n6.4.9 Recordkeeping\\nA. Safety Programs shall maintain records of Asbestos Awareness training for a minimum of one \\nyear.\\n6.4.10 Controls\\nA. Refer to Section 6.4.5: \" Asbestos Surveys \" and Section 6.4.6: \" Exposure Monitoring \" sections \\nfor details.\\n6.4.11 Process Measurements\\nA. The Asbestos written program is reviewed by Occupational Safety on an annual basis to ensure \\nany regulatory changes are addressed.\\n6.4.12 Interfaces\\nA. Safety Programs Asbestos Survey\\n6.4.13 Asbestos Related Terminology\\nA. Asbestos means naturally occurring hydrated mineral silicates separable into commercially used \\nfibers, specifically chrysotile, amosite, crocidolite, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite.\\nB. Asbestos Containing Materials (ACM) means materials formed by mixing asbestos fibers with \\nother products for a final mixture of 1% or greater asbestos by weight.\\nC. Friable Asbestos means any materials applied onto ceilings, walls, structural members, piping, \\nductwork or any other part of the building structure which, when dry, may be crumbled, \\npulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure.\\nD. Nonfriable Asbestos materials means any materials which cannot by crumbled easily. These \\nproducts, such as vinyl floor tile, mastic and transite board, do not normally create an exposure \\nhazard; however, grinding, sanding or sawing will cause the release of asbestos fibers.\\nE. Fiber means a particulate form of asbestos 5 microns or longer and with a length-to-width ratio \\nof 3 to 1.\\nF. Enclosure means the construction of airtight walls and ceilings between the asbestos material \\nand the facility environment, or around surfaces coated with asbestos, or any other appropriate \\nscientific procedure as determined to prevent the release of asbestos materials.\\nG. Encapsulation means the coating or spraying of asbestos materials with a sealant.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202323 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.5 Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan\\nA. The Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan has been established to minimize the risk of \\ninfection caused by bloodborne pathogens. This program affects any employee having a \\nreasonable probability of contact with bloodborne pathogens.\\n6.5.1 Responsibility and Authority\\nA. The VP, Safety & Security is responsible for the implementation and the quality of the \\nBloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan.\\nB. The Director, Safety Programs has the authority to establish and modify this plan.\\nC. To minimize the risk of infection caused by bloodborne pathogens. This program affects any \\nemployee having a reasonable probability of contact with bloodborne pathogens.\\n6.5.2 Exposure Determination\\nA. Certain job tasks, procedures, and job classifications that have the potential for an occupational \\nexposure to bloodborne pathogens have been identified. These determinations have been made \\nwithout regard to the use of personal protective equipment. Occupational exposure means a \\n“reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral contact with blood or other \\npotentially infectious materials that may result from the performance of the employee\\'s duties.”\\nB. The following job classifications have been identified as having a reasonable probability of \\ncontact with bloodborne pathogens:\\n1. Flight Attendants\\n2. Aircraft Technicians\\n3. Aircraft Investigations and Recovery Teams (as necessitates)\\n4. Supervisor Housekeeping (Prudhoe Bay only)\\n5. Aircraft Cabin Cleaners\\nC. The following tasks and procedures have been identified as a having a reasonable probability of \\ncontact with bloodborne pathogens:\\n1. Administering first aid (as part of one’s job duties)\\n2. Cleaning aircraft (both during and after flight)\\n3. Servicing lavatories and other related maintenance duties\\n4. Housekeeping duties (Prudhoe Bay only)\\nD. Other employees should not be occupationally exposed to bloodborne pathogens during normal \\noperations. Employees who feel they might perform tasks described above or others with the \\npotential for contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM) should contact \\nAirport Operations Safety.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202324 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.5.3 Training\\nA. Employees who fall under the above categories are required to participate in training prior to \\nassignment of any covered tasks where occupational exposure to blood or OPIM may occur, \\nand annually thereafter. Additional training is required if an employee’s job duties or procedures \\nchange in such a way that creates new or different ways to receive an occupational exposure. \\nSupervisors are subject to the same training requirements as their affected employee groups.\\n6.5.4 Exposure Controls\\nA. Employees that are either in the identified job classifications or the identified tasks and \\nprocedures are required to follow the exposure controls listed in this section.\\n1. Universal Precautions: All blood and body fluid contamination is to be handled as if it were \\ninfected with bloodborne pathogens. This approach, which considers all blood and body \\nfluids to be infectious, is termed “Universal Precautions”. Universal Precautions shall be \\nobserved at all times, by all employees, when working with equipment that has been \\ncontaminated.\\n2. Engineering and Work Practice Controls: Engineering and work practice controls are to be \\nused to eliminate or minimize employee exposure where the tasks described in Exposure \\nDetermination are being performed. Where occupational exposure remains after institution \\nof these controls, personal protective equipment is to be used.\\n3. Hand washing: Employees must wash with warm running water and non-abrasive soap \\nimmediately or as soon as feasible after removal of gloves or other protective equipment.\\n4. Contaminated Needles: All used needles should be picked up with forceps, if available, and \\nplaced as soon as possible in a sharps container directly into a puncture-resistant container \\nand sealed. Hands shall not be placed in containers or aircraft seat pockets unless the \\nemployee visually verifies that no sharps are present.\\n5. Broken Glassware: Do not pick up broken glassware with the hands if it may have been \\ncontaminated. Use a mechanical means such as a brush and dust pan, tongs, or forceps to \\nminimize the potential for cuts and puncture wounds. Place in a labeled puncture-resistant \\ncontainer. Decontaminate the device used to pick up the glass.\\n6. Trash: Assume all trash containers have a needle in them. Avoid reaching into a fixed trash \\nreceptacle. Handle trash bags carefully. Do not pack down with your hands or feet, or swing \\nthe bag onto your back or against your legs or thighs.\\n7. Prohibited Activities: Where there is a reasonable likelihood of exposure, eating, drinking, \\nsmoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm and handling contact lenses is prohibited.\\n8. Contaminated Equipment: Equipment which has become contaminated must be \\ndecontaminated as necessary before being serviced or used. The universally accepted \\nBiohazard symbol shall be attached to the contaminated equipment stating which portions \\nare contaminated until decontamination has taken place.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202325 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n9. Personal Protective Equipment: Personal protective equipment will be readily accessible, \\nwill be provided at no cost to the employee, and will be used as necessary to prevent \\ncontact with blood and body fluids. The protective equipment must not permit blood or body \\nfluids to contact the employee’s clothes, skin, eyes, mouth or other mucous membranes \\nduring normal conditions of use and for the duration of time for which the protective \\nequipment will be used.\\nB. Local management will assure that appropriate personal protective equipment in a variety of \\nsizes is readily accessible at the worksite or is issued to employees. A standard kit of personal \\nprotective equipment is available through Supply Chain Management. Refer to Section 6.5.6: \\n\"Ordering Bloodborne Pathogen Protection/Cleanup Materials \". If the kit is broken open and \\nportions of the kit are missing, a new kit should be ordered. (Exception: if the kit is a Universal \\nPrecaution Kit (UPK) from an AS aircraft; those kits can be returned directly to AS Fleet Services \\nfor replenishment/replacement.) The following are examples of appropriate personal protective \\nequipment:\\n1. Gloves: Gloves shall be worn when performing those tasks listed in Exposure \\nDetermination. Use good judgment when assisting passengers with disabilities. Replace \\ndisposable, single-use gloves as soon as practical when contaminated, torn, punctured or \\nwhen their ability to function as a barrier is compromised. Disposable gloves shall not be \\nwashed or decontaminated for reuse. Utility gloves may be decontaminated for re-use if the \\nintegrity of the glove is not compromised. Utility gloves must be discarded if they are \\ncracked, peeling, torn, punctured, or exhibit other signs of deterioration, or when their ability \\nto function as a barrier is compromised.\\n2. Masks, Eye Protection, and Face Shields: Masks, in combination with eye protection \\ndevices, such as goggles or glasses with solid side shields, or chin-length face shields, \\nshall be worn whenever splashes, spray, splatter, or droplets of blood or other potentially \\ninfectious materials may be generated and eye, nose, or mouth contamination can be \\nreasonably anticipated.\\n3. CPR/First Aid: Should it be necessary to administer CPR or first aid to a fellow employee or \\nto a passenger, gloves and a microshield or pocket mask are available for use in most cabin \\nand ground first aid kits.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202326 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.5.5 Housekeeping/Laundry\\nA. Decontamination: Contaminated solid surfaces should be decontaminated with an appropriate \\nEPA-registered tuberculocidal disinfectant as soon as feasible. For non-aircraft work facility \\nareas, an appropriate disinfectant would be bleach and water (1:10 mix) for most impermeable \\ncolor-fast surfaces. However, bleach is not to be used on aircraft interior surfaces, as chlorine \\nsolutions have proven to be corrosive to them. Gloves shall be worn during decontamination. \\nMaintenance Control should be consulted if aircraft carpeting, mechanical/electrical equipment \\nor fixed non-colorfast surfaces have been contaminated. Removable/disposable items, such as \\nseat covers, cushions, pillows, and blankets, should be disposed of as biohazardous waste if \\nthey are contaminated with blood or OPIM.\\nB. Biohazardous waste: Biohazardous waste includes sharps and/or other materials contaminated \\nwith human blood or OPIM. Disposal of all biohazardous waste shall be in accordance with all \\napplicable federal, state, and local regulations.\\nC. Material contaminated with urine, vomit, and/or feces are not normally regulated as a \\nbiohazardous waste. Items contaminated with non-blood, non-OPIM bodily fluids are not \\nregulated and should be well bagged and placed in an appropriate solid waste dumpster. If the \\ncontaminated item is something of value, such as an article of clothing or a seat cover, advise a \\nsupervisor so that it may be sent out for repair and/or cleaning. Do not use biohazardous waste \\nbags for containing and transporting soiled laundry.\\nD. Place all biohazardous material in a labeled (see example below) container that is: sealed and \\nleak resistant, impervious to moisture, rigid and puncture resistant (if containing sharp material \\nor glass), break resistant and tightly lidded or stoppered. Disposable “red bags”, suitable for \\ncontaminated absorbents and other soft materials, are available through Supply Chain \\nManagement – PeopleSoft (see below). Double-bagging prior to handling, storing and/or \\ntransporting biohazardous waste is necessary if the outside of the bag is contaminated with \\nblood or other potentially infectious material.\\nE. Larger stations, such as SEA and ANC, have biohazardous waste collection containers that are \\nserviced by a scheduled medical waste hauler. Smaller stations, which do not have a contracted \\nbiohazardous waste hauler, may dispose of their sharps and/or blood/OPIM-contaminated \\nmaterials as described below. Do not ship biohazardous waste as co-mat to other stations for \\ndisposal. Approved disposal methods for biohazardous wastes are:\\n1. Through a permitted onsite airport incinerator;\\n2. Acceptance by a local medical clinic;\\n3. Via a permitted “mailback” program. A postage-paid container will be delivered to your \\nstation in which you can mail back the biohazardous waste to a permitted incinerator (call \\nStericycle @ 1-800-355-8773)\\n4. Collection and disposal by a licensed medical waste management vendor; or Solidification \\nby use of an “isolyzer” or similar biowaste disposal system. Medical waste is disinfected and \\nsolidified in a container via an exothermic (heat producing) reaction. This treated solid \\nmatrix is approved for landfill disposal in most states.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202327 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.5.6 Ordering Bloodborne Pathogen Protection/Cleanup Materials\\nA. Alaska Airlines Stations and/or Inflight can order pre-assembled UPKs directly through AS Fleet \\nServices (for a UPK content list see http://airportservices.insideaag.com/csm/vol6/links/\\nUPK_kit.pdf ). Company personnel can order items through Supply Change Management – \\nPeopleSoft as follows:\\nB. Item:\\n1. Bag, International Autoclave, Red 38x47 4mil 50/case – PeopleSoft Item 102857 (used as \\nBiohazard bags and also used on all international flights)\\n2. Bloodborne Pathogen Protection Kit, EA, First Aid PeopleSoft Item 102771 (Grainger P/N \\n5DXX4)\\n3. Medical, Body Fluid Clean-Up Kit – PeopleSoft Item 102832 (Grainger P/N 5ELW0)\\n6.5.7 Warning Labels\\nWarning labels must be attached to all items that are contaminated with blood and/or OPIM. This \\nlabel will specify what part of the item is contaminated and must be affixed so it does not fall off or get \\nseparated. The warning label must use the universally recognized BIOHAZARD symbol (see below). \\nAny waste container bolding blood and/or OPIM must also have a warning label attached.\\nFigure 6-1: Universally Recognized Biohazard Symbol\\nRev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202328 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.5.8 Hepatitis B Vaccination (HBV)\\nA. Employees identified in the exposure determination will be offered the opportunity to be \\nvaccinated with the Hepatitis B Vaccination, at no cost to the employee, at a reasonable time \\nand place, and under the supervision of a physician or licensed health care professional. \\nEmployees offered the vaccination must sign a waiver/consent form, whether they decide to \\naccept or decline the vaccination. Booster doses must be offered if recommended by the \\nphysician/health care professional. Employees that initially decline the vaccination may later \\ndecide to accept the vaccination provided the employees is still in a job classification with \\noccupational exposure.\\nB. Form IR-13 for documenting an employee’s decision to accept/decline the Hepatitis B \\nvaccination is available through Supply Chain Management WorkflowOne (form number 0-0410-\\n2-1474).\\n6.5.9 Post-Exposure Incident Follow-up\\nA. Any incident involving the presence of blood or OPIM in which the employee feels that he/she \\nhas been exposed to shall be immediately reported by the employee to his/her supervisors.\\nB. The supervisor or manager, together with the employee will determine if an exposure has \\noccurred. An exposure is defined as an incident which occurs during the performance of the \\nemployees’ duties in which there was contact of the eyes, mouth, other mucous membranes, or \\nnon-intact skin with blood and/or OPIM. (An incident in which appropriate work practices and \\npersonal protective equipment are used which prevents blood and/or body fluid from contacting \\nthe eyes, mouth, other mucous membranes, or non-intact skin is not considered an exposure.)\\nC. If an exposure incident has been identified by the supervisor or manager, the exposed employee \\nis offered a confidential medical evaluation, follow-up, and counseling by or under the \\nsupervision of a licensed physician within 24 hours of the exposure incident. Contact Safety \\nPrograms or the Worker’s Compensation Department for assistance. The Alaska or Horizon \\nemployee should then fill out a Bodily Fluid Exposure Form (WS-4) and forward the top copy to \\nSEAWO where it will be logged. The Bodily Fluid Exposure Form is available to Company \\nemployees at Alaskasworld.com >Manuals/Forms>Safety (printable form is located within \\nappropriate workgroup tab).Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202329 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.5.10 Recordkeeping\\nA. Safety Programs and Worker’s Compensation Department are responsible for maintaining \\nconfidential medical records of all incidents involving employees who have been exposed to a \\ncommunicable disease while at work.\\nB. There are two types of records required by the bloodborne pathogens standard: medical and \\ntraining.\\n1. Medical records must be established for each employee with occupational exposure. This \\nrecord is confidential and separate from other personnel records. This record may be kept \\non-site or may be retained by the health care professional who provides services to \\nemployees. The medical record contains the employee\\'s name, social security number, \\nhepatitis B vaccination status, including the dates of vaccination and the written opinion of \\nthe health care professional regarding the hepatitis B vaccination. If an occupational \\nexposure occurs, reports are added to the medical record to document the incident and the \\nresults of testing following the incident. The post-evaluation written opinion of the health \\ncare professional is also part of the medical record. The medical record also must \\ndocument what information has been provided to the health care provider. Medical records \\nmust be maintained 30 years past the last date of employment of the employee. Medical \\nrecords will be made available to the employee or to anyone authorized, in writing, by the \\nemployee.\\n2. Training records will be maintained by individual departments for 3 years and must include \\nthe date, content outline, trainer’s name and qualifications, and names and job titles of all \\npersons attending the training sessions.\\n6.5.11 Controls\\nA.

Refer to Section 6.6.13: \" Definitions \"Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202333 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.6.3 Entry System for Permit-Required Confined Space\\nA. IDENTIFICATION- The job supervisor will identify and evaluate all potential confined spaces in \\nthe area. Spaces identified as “confined spaces” will be posted as follows: “DANGER. PERMIT- \\nREQUIRED CONFINED SPACE. DO NOT ENTER.”\\nB. ENTRY TEAM- Each confined space Entry Team will be responsible for:\\n1. Completing and posting the entry permit. (See Attachment #4).\\n2. Testing the atmospheric condition of the confined space to ensure adequate ventilation and/\\nor atmosphere able to sustain employee health.\\n3. Taking positive steps to prevent the introduction of hazardous materials or mechanized and \\nelectrical movement.\\n4. Ensuring that appropriate standby is in effect prior to entry.\\n5. Ensuring that an action plan for emergencies and rescue is in place.\\n6. Initiating any additional safeguards before entry.\\n7. Terminating entry when work is complete or the condition of the hazard changes, or if \\nEntrants experience any ill effects such as dizziness, irritation, or odor change.\\nC. ENTRY PERMIT (See Attachment A) - The entry permit specifies the location and type of work \\nto be done and certifies that existing hazards have been evaluated and necessary protective \\nmeasures have been reviewed with all persons involved prior to entry.\\n1. The permit will be dated and valid for one scheduled work shift only. The permit will be \\nupdated for each additional shift with the original or modified requirements being fulfilled.\\n2. The Entry Team must fill out an entry permit after evaluation of all hazards prior to entry. \\nThe Gas Checker will record and place his or her initials by the results of any pre-entry \\natmospheric testing recorded on the permit. The permit must be signed by the Entry \\nSupervisor.\\n3. The Entry Team will post the entry permit(s) at or near the entry points.\\n4. Upon completion of the job, the entry permits are to be forwarded to the Entry Supervisor.\\n5. All entry permits are to be maintained on file for at least one year. Permits are to be \\nreviewed within twelve (12) months to allow upgrade of the procedure.\\nD. PERMIT EXEMPTION - Under certain conditions a Permit-Required Confined Space may be \\ntemporarily reclassified as a Non-Permit-Required Space. While it is reclassified, entries may \\ntake place without a written permit or the presence of an attendant.\\n1. All hazards addressed by the Initial Survey (see Appendix A) and any additional hazard \\nintroduced by planned work activities, excepting hazardous atmospheres, must be \\neliminated or isolated from the space in a verifiable manner.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202334 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n2. Any actual or potential hazardous atmosphere identified in the Initial Survey and any \\nadditional contaminants introduced by the planned work activities must be controlled to a \\nsafe level through the use of forced ventilation alone. The safety of the confined space \\natmosphere must be demonstrated through inspection and monitoring data.\\n3. An Entry Supervisor or other qualified individual must certify in writing that the permit-\\nrequired space has been reclassified. (see Appendix A) This certification must be made \\navailable to the entrants.\\n4. Entrants must evacuate the reclassified area immediately if any hazard is discovered during \\nthe entry. Any subsequent entries will be under Permit-Required conditions.\\n5. Activities to eliminate or control hazards from outside the space do not require the use of an \\nEntry Permit. If an entry into the space is required to eliminate a hazard, for example to turn \\na valve or isolate a piece of equipment, it must be done using the Entry Permit system.\\n6. The reclassification is valid only while all controls remain in place.\\n6.6.4 Entry Procedures\\nA. ISOLATION - The supervisor is responsible for ensuring that positive steps are taken to prevent \\naccidental introduction of hazardous materials through interconnecting equipment, such as \\npiping, ducts, vents, or drains.\\nB. This may require the following:\\nIsolation:\\n1. Eliminating conditions making it unsafe to remove the entrance cover.\\n2. Physically blocking mechanical parts capable of independent movement.\\n3. Protecting openings with use of barriers or temporary covering where necessary.\\n4. Removal of a valve or spool piece and blanking (blinding or capping) the open end of active \\npiping.\\n5. Inserting a full-pressure blank between the flanges nearest to the confined space.\\n6. Closing two block valves with an open drain valve between them. All three valves should be \\nlocked/tagged in the appropriate position.\\na. Safety Lockout/Tagout: The primary electrical disconnect shall be locked/tagged in the \\n“open” position to prevent the operation of pumps, slides, gates, agitators, etc.\\nb. Security: Components, which are hazardous due to gravitational or stored energy \\nforces, shall be secured in position or energy stores shall be relieved. The Entry Team \\nshall make certain no one is allowed inside the space while efforts are being made to \\nremove the contents by gravity flow through the side or bottom of the space.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202335 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nC.Purging/Inerting  - After isolation, the Entry Team shall ensure that the space is adequately \\npurged (a minimum of five (5) air changes, or ten (10) air changes for toxic atmospheres). \\nPurging shall be accomplished using the optimal airflow configuration for the specific type of \\nspace. Continuous ventilation may be required. Refer to the Confined Space Entry Permit for \\npurging requirements.\\nCAUTION\\nOxygen shall never be used for purging.\\nFlammable spaces may require inertion. Alaska Airlines/Horizon Air personnel shall not enter \\ninerted spaces. Contractors entering such spaces will be required to have in effect a confined \\nspace entry program that adequately addresses the requirements of entry into an inerted space.\\nD.Gas Testing - Tests for toxicity, flammability, and oxygen deficiency, where required, must be \\nmade by a qualified Gas Checker before an entry permit is issued. The test order should be \\noxygen, flammables and then toxics. Tests should be made frequently enough to ensure that \\nsafe conditions prevail. Continuous monitoring may be necessary when conditions within the \\nspace may change rapidly or highly toxic contaminants may be involved.\\nE. Hazardous work may include welding, hot work, painting, grinding, sandblasting, etc. (Refer to \\ndefinition of hazardous atmosphere for allowable oxygen and flammable levels.) Toxic levels are \\nspecified per space or may require determination based on work performed. If there is any \\nreason to question the validity of the test evaluation, the hazard will be considered to be high \\nand personal protective equipment or measures used accordingly.\\n6.6.5 Precautionary Measures and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)\\nA. PPE and precautions for the confined space shall be determined using the Initial Survey Data \\nand the Pre Entry Gas Testing Results. (see Appendix A)\\nB. Additional protection may be required depending upon the work being performed. For \\nassistance in PPE selection, contact your immediate supervisor or Manager, Airport Operations \\nSafety.\\nC. The area shall be evacuated if any indication of ill effects such as dizziness, irritation or \\nexcessive odors are noted.\\nD. Fire extinguishing equipment shall be immediately available.\\nE. All tools and equipment shall be available as required. Specifications shall be developed for \\nconfined space rescue equipment. Adequate stock of equipment including spare parts must be \\nmaintained. Portable electric tools shall be grounded or isolation transformers, ground fault \\ninterrupters, or insulated tools provided.\\nF. Emergency lighting shall be available as required.\\nG. Personnel will minimize the use of flammable and/or toxic chemicals such as solvents, paints \\nand strippers within the confined space by bringing only the minimum amount of material \\nnecessary to finish the job at hand. Containers of toxic and/or flammable materials must never \\nbe stored in the space and must be protected against spills.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202336 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nH. Compressed gas cylinders should not be allowed in a confined space. Compressed gas lines \\nshall be protected from rupture or damage. Compressed gas cylinders or generators should be \\nattended at all times. Sources of compressed gases or arc welding power shall be turned off \\nimmediately when an emergency arises or when work is interrupted or completed.\\nI. Safety equipment (lanyards, lines, etc.) will be inspected for damage prior to utilization. \\nDamaged equipment will not be used and will be appropriately discarded.\\nJ. If medical surveillance is required for specific exposures (other than those normally tested for \\nduring annual medical evaluations), the Entry Supervisor will notify the Entrant and the Airport \\nOperations Safety department of the specific exposure (i.e., new MSDS or new material).\\nK. RESCUE - Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air will utilize outside emergency rescue services. \\nRescue plans by type of space will be reviewed and coordinated with outside emergency \\nservices upon implementation of this policy or when changes occur. Rescue emergency \\nservices are obtained as follows:\\n1. Local Emergency Number\\n2. If no answer then dial 911.\\n3. The Attendant outside a Permit-Required space shall have immediate access to a means of \\nsummoning emergency services such as a radio, a permanently installed telephone or a \\ncellular telephone within sight of their duty location.\\n6.6.6 Hot Work\\nA. Hot work refers to any work activities that have the potential to ignite combustible materials or \\nflammable/explosive vapors at the job site. Examples include welding, burning, grinding and the \\nuse of internal combustion engines. The use of electrical equipment, electric motors in areas \\nwhere flammable/explosive vapors may be present is also considered hot work unless that \\nequipment has been rated as “Intrinsically Safe” for use under those conditions by the \\nUnderwriters Laboratories (UL) or other qualified rating agency. The following precautions will be \\nfollowed as a minimum for all confined space activities involving hot work.\\n1. Appropriately classified fire extinguishing equipment shall be easily accessible to \\nemployees performing hot work in confined spaces. Fire extinguishers shall not be \\ndischarged inside the confined space until the personnel inside have been evacuated \\nbecause the fire extinguishers discharge may deplete or displace the oxygen within the \\nspace.\\n2. Where coatings are flammable, or would decompose under hot work into toxic, corrosive or \\nirritant components, they should be stripped for at least 12 inches from the point of heat \\napplication. This includes paints that may contain lead, zinc or other toxic components.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202337 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.6.7 Non-Alaska Airlines or Horizon Air Personnel\\nA.

Coordinate entry operations with the contractor, when both host employer personnel and \\ncontractor personnel will be working in or near permit spaces.\\n5. Debrief the contractor at the conclusion of the entry operations regarding the permit space \\nprogram followed and any hazards confronted or created in permit required spaces during \\nentry operation. Obtain copies of the contractor’s confined space documents, to be \\nforwarded to the hiring department.\\n6.6.8 Training\\nA. Training will be provided to all employees who must enter confined spaces, serve as an \\nattendant, or supervise confined space entries. Training will be designed to ensure that all \\naffected employees acquire the understanding, knowledge, and skills necessary for the safe \\nperformance of their duties as they relate to confined space entry.\\nB. Training shall be provided to each affected employee:\\n1. Before the employee is first assigned to enter a confined space or serve as an attendant.\\n2. Before assigned duties are changed.\\n3. Whenever there is a change in permit space operations that presents a hazard about which \\nan employee has not been previously trained.\\n4. Whenever the employer has reason to believe either that there are deviations from the \\npermit space entry procedures or that there are inadequacies in the employee’s knowledge \\nor use of these procedures.\\n5. Training must be documented by a certification containing i) the employee’s name; ii) name \\nand signature of the trainer; and iii) the date of training.

Chemical selections shall only be made from the Approved Chemical List. No \\nchemicals may be purchased until they have been reviewed by the applicable \\ndepartments identified in this section. The only exception is for purchase of consumer \\nproducts (see description below) or Aircraft on Ground (AOG) situation (an Approval \\nRequest must be submitted at this time)\\nb. No chemical may be used at any Horizon Air facility until a MSDS/SDS is available to \\nthe employee using the chemical. Any department that receives MSDS/SDS’s for any \\nreason shall promptly submit the originals to SafetyRev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202390 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nc. For each chemical review, applicable departments evaluating each product or process \\nchange shall assess all possible risks (e.g., passenger and employee safety, aircraft \\nmanufacturer warranties and specifications, environmental risks, etc.). Every effort will \\nbe made by the review departments to ensure that risk is not shifted from one group to \\nanother\\nB. Consumer Products Exception\\n1. Some hazardous materials do not require a formal chemical review process. If a hazardous \\nmaterial is purchased in consumer packaging (e.g., grocery stores) and Horizon Airlines \\ncan show that its use in the workplace does not increase the duration and/or frequency of \\nexposure, it does not require formal chemical evaluation. Products such as dish soap, \\nlaundry detergents, and office correction liquids are common examples of exempted \\nconsumer products.\\n2. To ensure employees have access to all chemical information, Environmental Affairs \\nrequires that all hazardous materials, including consumer products, have a corresponding \\nMSDS/SDS on site and available for review. MSDS/SDS’s for consumer products may be \\nadded to the Approved Chemical List if they are used at many stations /facilities.\\nC. Aircraft Maintenance Emergencies Exception\\n1. If a product is specifically named in an aircraft maintenance manual or aircraft \\nmanufacturer’s document and its immediate purchase is required to return an aircraft to \\nservice, it may be purchased prior to review. A chemical review request must be made at \\nthe same time as the material requisition to purchase. In all cases, MSDS/SDS’s and any \\nneeded safety equipment must be available to employees prior to it use of the chemical(s).\\n6.14.4 Chemical Review and Approval Process\\nA. The requestor must prepare and submit all new requests using the Chemical Review Checklist \\nform (HA-611) to ensure that all new chemicals are evaluated prior to use. (Forms are available \\non the AAG Safety website under QX Reporting/More Forms, Templates/Checklist/ Chemical \\nReview Request Form). New requests are sent to PDXSHAS. Safety coordinates review with \\nappropriate departments and notifies the requestor if the chemical has been approved or not \\napproved.\\nB. Each request for approval must include a copy of the MSDS/SDS (the MSDS/SDS must be the \\nlatest revision from the manufacturer) for the specific brand and part number of the requested \\nchemical. Not all types of products (i.e., lacquer thinner) are the same and may have different \\nformulations and different hazards. Some products that contain only a single constituent (i.e., \\noxygen, etc.) are available from a variety of manufacturers. Basic health and safety information \\nis identical so separate manufacturer MSDS/SDS’s are not required.\\nC. If the chemical being requested is specifically called out in the manufacturer maintenance or \\nrepair manuals, the specification and page number must be listed on the Chemical Review \\nRequest. This is required by Engineering to confirm that the chemical has been approved, by the \\nmanufacturer, for use on aircraft.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202391 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nD.

The Chemical Storage policy sets guidelines on proper storage practices and general handling \\nprocedures of various classifications of chemicals to which employees may be exposed. \\nProducts are normally segregated into basic classifications. This is done to prevent inadvertent \\nmixing of incompatible chemicals which can produce harmful gases/vapors, heat, fire, and \\npossibly explosions.\\nB. Specific regulations apply to certain products dependent on quantities, and this will be covered \\nin this policy as well.\\nNOTE\\nChemical storage practices apply both to chemical products and to hazardous waste generated \\nby AAG. Hazardous waste is covered with its own written policy and further information can be \\nfound under the Resources section of this document.\\n6.15.1 Chemical Classifications\\nA. Chemical substances we commonly use can be segregated into classes that include \\nflammables, corrosives, and oxidizers.\\nB. The classifications below are the most common types of chemicals an employee can expect to \\nfind while working at AAG.\\nC. Compressed gases will be included in this section as its own classification, although the product \\nitself would be considered one of the previously mentioned classes.\\n6.15.1.1 Flammable and Combustible Liquids\\nA. Flammable and Combustible liquids are classified into three classes with subclasses within \\nthem. The table below defines each class and gives examples of each:\\nTable 6-4: Flammable and Combustible Liquids\\nFlammable \\nCategoriesClassification Term Flash Point and \\nBoiling PointExamples\\nCategory 1 Class IA Flammable FP Below 73°F\\nBoils below 100°FEther\\nMethane\\nCategory 2 Class IB Flammable FP Below 73°F\\nBoils above 100°FAcetone, MEK, Toluene, \\nMethanol, Ethanol, \\nGasoline\\nCategory 3 Class IC Flammable FP Above 73°F\\nBoils below 100°FLiquid Propane\\nCategory 3 Class II Combustible FP At or above 100°F Jet A, Diesel, JP-8Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202394 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.15.1.2 Corrosives\\nA. A corrosive chemical is a broad term for products on the opposite ends of the pH scale, with 7 \\nbeing a neutral product. Corrosives include acids and bases (caustics). They can destroy living \\ntissue and corrode metal. The extent of damage depends on multiple factors such as type and \\nconcentration of the chemical, route of exposure, type of tissue contacted, and speed in \\napplying emergency measures.\\nB. Corrosive acids are those products with a pH lower than 2.5 on the pH scale. These include \\nvarious concentrated acids used in some maintenance operations.\\nC. Corrosive bases (caustics) are those products with a pH higher than 11. Examples include \\nsodium hydroxide (lye) found in certain drain cleaners.\\nD. Both of these types of products can still cause harm if the pH isn’t within their respective ranges. \\nThey can still cause irritation at points of contact if exposed, which is why reviewing MSDS/SDS \\nare important prior to handling.\\n6.15.1.3 Oxidizers\\nA. Oxidizing materials are in a chemical group that encompass a large group of products which \\nmay actually be part of another classification.\\nB. Oxidizers are those products which cause other substances to burn more readily and more \\nintensely when in contact. Oxidizers can be found in many forms including liquids and gases, \\nincluding compressed gases such as welding oxygen and aircraft oxygen.Category 4 Class IIIA Combustible FP At or above 140°F Jet A, JP-5\\nCategory 4 Class IIIB Combustible FP At or above 200°F General Hydraulic Fluid, \\nLube OilTable 6-4: Flammable and Combustible Liquids (Continued)\\nFlammable \\nCategoriesClassification Term Flash Point and \\nBoiling PointExamplesRev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202395 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.15.1.4 Compressed Gases\\nA. Compressed Gas Cylinders (CGC) are not generally thought of as a hazard classification of \\nsubstances. CGC can contain any number of substances which can be in gaseous or liquid \\nstates. Cylinders can be extremely hazardous when misused or abused. There are a variety of \\nhazards due to the pressure and/or contents.\\nB. The vast majority of compressed gases found at AAG locations fall into a select few categories: \\noxidizers (pure oxygen), inert gases (nitrogen), and fuel gases (acetylene).\\nNOTE\\nTherapeutic oxygen cylinders for medical usage onboard and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) \\ncylinders commonly used for forklifts and gas grills are not considered CGC under this policy \\nand not subject to the same storage policies. These will be covered separately in Section 6.15.2: \\n\"Storage Guidelines \" of this document.\\n6.15.2 Storage Guidelines\\nA. This section gives the specific guidelines and policies on storage of the various classifications of \\nchemical products covered under this policy.\\n6.15.2.1 Flammable and Combustible Liquids\\nA. There are several regulations which apply to the storage of flammable and combustible liquids. \\nFlammable liquids must not be kept in areas that may limit use of exits, stairways, or normal \\npaths of egress by people. This policy does not apply to aerosol spray cans containing \\nflammable materials.\\nB. Flammable liquids in secondary containers must be kept in approved safety cans by a nationally \\nrecognized testing laboratory. This type of container does not have more than a 5 gallon \\ncapacity, has a self-closing lid, spout cover, and is designed so it will safely relieve internal \\npressure when subjected to fire exposure. These safety cans are readily available for purchase \\nin most commercial catalogs.\\nC. Safety cabinets, otherwise known as flammable cabinets, are also utilized for storing flammable \\nand combustible liquids. Flammable cabinets have specific regulations on their construction and \\nstorage capacities. Regulations on the construction of and storage inside flammable cabinets \\nare below:\\n1. Up to 60 gallons of Class I or II flammable liquids and up to 120 gallons of Class III of \\nflammable liquids may be kept in one storage cabinet\\n2. Bottom/Top/Sides must be constructed of at least 18 gauge steel\\n3. Must be double walled with one inch airspace\\n4. Joints must be riveted/welded or made tight by equally effective means\\n5. Doors must be self-closingRev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202396 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6. Doors must be 2 inches above the bottom to retain any spilled liquid within the cabinet\\n7. Cabinets must have a Flammable-Keep Fire Away posting on it\\n8. Must have a fire resistance of at least 30 minutes\\nD. Flammable liquids may be stored outside of a flammable cabinet, also. The list below shows the \\namount allowed to be stored outside of flammable storage cabinets of each flammable and \\ncombustible liquid class. There are no restrictions of where they can be stored other than \\nsegregation from reactive products.\\nE. Best Management Practice is to provide secondary containment for flammable liquids stored \\noutside of flammable cabinets.\\nF. The list below is the quantity of liquid that may be located outside of a storage cabinet in one \\narea inside a building and shall not exceed:\\n1. 25 gallons of Class IA liquids in containers\\n2. 120 gallons of Class IB, IC, II, or III liquids in containers\\n3. 660 gallons of Class IB, IC, II, or III liquids in a single portable tank\\nNOTE\\nGasoline is a Class IB flammable liquid. Always refer to the MSDS/SDS for information on \\nflammable classification and/or flash and boiling points.\\n6.15.2.2 Corrosive Liquids\\nA. Storage of corrosive liquids can be complicated and need to be evaluated on an individual basis. \\nAcids and bases must not be stored together, or in a manner which may have them come into \\ncontact with each other. Corrosive liquids do not have to be stored in a special corrosive cabinet, \\nalthough they are commercially available. Acids and bases must be segregated in cabinets as \\nwell.\\nB. Corrosive liquids must be stored in such a manner as to not come in contact with flammables, \\noxidizers, or other materials that could cause a chemical reaction. These areas shall be labeled \\nas to what materials are located in the area.\\n6.15.2.3 Reactive Materials\\nA. In general, the guidelines below can be used to assist in evaluating storage of chemicals:\\n1. Ignitables must be segregated from Reactives\\n2. Acids must be segregated from Caustics\\n3. Corrosives should be segregated from Flammables\\n4. Oxidizers should be segregated from Everything, including general combustible materials \\nsuch as cardboard\\n5. Many Corrosives are Water ReactiveRev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202397 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6. Most Organic Reactives must be segregated from Inorganic Reactives (Metals)\\nB. The table and information below contains storage incompatibilities of various types of materials.\\nTable 6-5: Storage Incompatibilities\\nIf the material contains: It may not be stored with any of the following:\\nAcid (pH below 2.0) Caustics (pH above 12.5)\\nReactive Metals\\nAlcohol\\nWater\\nAldehydes\\nHalogenated, Nitrated, or Unsaturated Hydrocarbons\\nReactive Organic Compounds and Solvents\\nOxidizers\\nCaustic (pH above 12.5) Acid (pH below 2.0)\\nReactive Metals\\nAlcohol\\nWater\\nAldehydes\\nHalogenated, Nitrated, or Unsaturated Hydrocarbons\\nReactive Organic Compounds and Solvents\\nReactive Metals Caustics\\nAcids\\nAlcohol\\nAldehydes\\nHalogenated, Nitrated, or Unsaturated Hydrocarbons\\nReactive Organic Compounds and Solvents\\nReactive Organic Compounds and Solvents Caustics\\nAcids\\nReactive Metals\\nOxidizers Oils and Grease\\nAcetic or Other Organic Acids\\nConcentrated Mineral Acids\\nReactive Metals\\nReactive Organic Compounds and Solvents\\nIgnitable (Flammable/Combustible) MaterialsRev. 1-2023\\n6/16/202398 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.15.2.4 Potential Reactions\\nA. The table below lists examples of each of the materials listed above in the segregation tables.\\n6.15.2.5 Compressed Gas Cylinders\\nA. Regardless of content, the general storage guidelines below are applicable to all bulk \\ncompressed gas cylinders not in use (meaning connected to a regulator or manifold) and \\nconsidered to be stored. Therapeutic Oxygen Cylinders (medical use cylinders) and liquefied \\npetroleum gas (LPG) cylinders are covered separately afterwards.\\n1. Must be stored with valve cover caps, if so equipped\\n2. Must be stored in the upright position, unless designed for storage/use in the horizontal \\nposition.\\na. Acetylene cylinders should never be stored in a horizontal position\\n3. Stored cylinders must be secured at all times to prevent tipping.\\na. Appropriate material, such as chain, plastic coated cable wire, commercial straps, etc. \\nshould be used and not cause damage to the cylinder.\\nb. Should be secured across the top half of the cylinder, and below the shoulder\\nc. Small cylinder stands, boxes, cartons, and other items may be used and are \\nappropriate to ensure small cylinders are secured from movement.\\n4. Do not store cylinders with pressure on the regulator\\n5. Cylinders must be segregated and labeled into Full or Empty groups or locations for each \\ncategory.\\n6. Storage areas for compressed gas cylinders must not contain any unnecessary combustible \\nmaterials or uncontrolled ignition sources.\\n7. Cylinders stored outside must be protected from weather extremes and combustible waste \\nand vegetation.\\n8. Oxidizers (oxygen) must be separated from flammable gases\\n9.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration oversees workplace safety and health for \\nUS industries covered by the OSH Act of 1970. Air transportation is covered by this act. Many \\nstates have their own “OSHA” programs and have similar names such as WISHA (Washington), \\nOR-OSHA (Oregon), Cal-OSHA (California), and AKOSH (Alaska). In most cases, Alaska \\nAirlines and Horizon Air operate under state-run programs.\\nB. There are several types of inspections: a Programmed Inspection, a Complaint Inspection, or \\none that occurs as a result of an accident. Complaint Inspections are normally limited to the \\ncomplaint-related items only. Expansion of the scope of the inspection only occurs in a \\nProgrammed Inspection or when the compliance officer finds hazards serious enough to justify \\ninspecting the entire facility.\\nC. AAG personnel are expected to cooperate fully with the legal requests of the inspector. Both the \\nAirport Operations Safety department and the Legal department are in place to assist with \\ninterpreting their needs. As a general rule, all requests for documents belonging to AAG or \\nproprietary information will need to be submitted in writing by the inspector. This policy is \\nintended to assist the location manager or management personnel on duty.\\n6.18.1 Responsibility and Authority\\nA. The VP, Safety & Security is responsible for the implementation and the quality of the OSHA \\nInspection policies.\\nB. The Managing Director, Safety Programs has the authority to establish and modify this policy.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023109 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.18.2 Inspections\\nA. Inspections occur in three distinct phases: opening conference, walk-through, and the closing \\nconference. The inspector may ask the on-site union representative if they wish to be present \\nduring the inspection. During the opening conference, the compliance officer explains who (s)he \\nis and why (s)he is at your facility. In the walk-through phase, the compliance officer inspects \\nyour facility for potential OSHA violations. Closing conferences may occur in the same day or, if \\nmore research or multiple visits are needed, at a later time.\\nB. An Inspector from a state or federal regulatory authority will often show up unannounced. The \\nfollowing steps are to be followed in order to minimize our risk of noncompliance during the \\ninspection.\\nC. All management personnel should be familiar with these procedures:\\n1. Examine the identification of the inspector. Have them wait in a comfortable office or \\nconference room while you notify Airport Operations Safety. Explain that this is our \\ncompany protocol and you will return promptly.\\n2. Notify the Safety Programs as soon as possible, who will make every attempt to come to \\nyour location to accompany you and the inspector during the inspection.\\n3. If someone from the Safety department is unavailable, leave a detailed message. Know the \\nagency name, the name of the inspector, and the nature of the inspection. If the inspector is \\nnot willing to reschedule the inspection to the following business day, locate an available \\nmanager with authority at your location. This is the appropriate person to interact with the \\ninspector. If this person is unfamiliar with any part of the operation, have a knowledgeable \\nsupervisor accompany this person on the inspection.\\n4. Always shadow the inspector. This means go with the inspector wherever he or she goes. If \\nthe inspector wants to observe employees operating a machine or mixing chemicals, go \\nwith him.\\n5. Abate any hazards noted by the inspector as quickly as possible, preferably before (s)he \\nleaves. By doing this you can have potential or alleged violations corrected by the time the \\nclosing conference occurs. This demonstrates good faith to the compliance officer.\\n6. The Compliance Officer may ask to see specific documents or training records. Only \\nproduce those documents that are requested by the officer. If you cannot locate a specific \\ndocument at your location, after consulting the AAG Safety Manual, advise the inspector \\nthat these records may be kept at corporate and ask to be able to produce them later. Do \\nnot assume the records are not available.\\n7. The OSHA inspector may ask to speak with affected employees. If asked, use good \\njudgment in selecting knowledgeable and courteous employees for the OSHA inspector to \\ninterview.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023110 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nD. Preparing for an Inspection in Advance\\n1. You can prepare for an inspection ahead of time by ensuring access to the following:\\na. Have posted all current federal and/or state required postings.\\nb. Have accessible past five years of OSHA-200/300 logs\\nc. There are several documents that will be required in almost every inspection.\\n1) Accident Prevention Program\\n2) Hazard Communication Program\\n3) OSHA-300 logs (on file at each location and in the Airport Operations Safety \\ndepartment)\\nE. Proof of Enforcement of Policies and Procedures\\n1. OSHA takes the position that even the best written program is worthless if it is kept on the \\nshelf and not enforced on a daily basis. Properly document all counseling and discipline of \\nemployees due to unsafe practices in the workplace. It is a good idea to keep a copy of any \\nsafety-related disciplinary actions, including verbal counseling, in a special file for \\ninspection purposes. Be able to produce the disciplinary procedure for violation of company \\npolicies.\\nF. Follow-up Actions\\n1. Write down a summary of the inspection, including the areas surveyed by the inspector, a \\ndescription of or similar photos or video taken, the names of the employees interviewed, \\nand any violations that were observed or complied with (fixed) at the time of the inspection. \\nBe sure to record as much as you can remember. It is important to have as much \\ninformation on the citations from our point of view as possible. We can be sure the \\ninspector’s report is quite comprehensive. Forward this report along with the inspector’s \\nbusiness cards or contact information to Safety Programs by email or comail to PDXSH.\\n6.18.3 Controls\\nA. Notification of Safety Programs when any inspector shows up on site\\nB. Submittal of follow-up report and supporting documents by the inspected location to Safety \\nPrograms\\nC. OSHA or State Agency findings will be closed\\n6.18.4 Process Measurements\\nA.

Periodically review to ensure appropriateness of PPE and training effectiveness.\\nC. Employees:\\n1. Be knowledgeable of the specific PPE that is available and what type of PPE is required for \\neach job task being performed.\\n2. Be knowledgeable of the proper use and limitations of PPE.\\n6.19.2.1 Controlling Hazards\\nA. Personal protective devices alone should not be relied on to provide protection against hazards, \\nbut should be used when engineering and administrative controls are unsuccessful in \\neliminating exposure to workplace hazards, whether physical, chemical, biological, or other \\nforms. PPE should be used in conjunction with engineering controls and safe work practices \\nwhenever possible. Certain general guidelines for assessing the foot, head, eye, face and hand \\nhazard situations that exist in each department or work area are used to match the protective \\ndevices to the particular hazard.\\n6.19.3 Use of Personal Protective Equipment\\nA. Employees shall become familiar with potential hazards and the type and effectiveness of \\nprotective equipment available. Supervisory personnel should be consulted if an individual is \\nunsure of what PPE is appropriate.\\nB. Protective devices are generally available in a variety of sizes. Care should be taken to ensure \\nthat the right size is selected.\\nC. Adjustments should be made on an individual basis for a comfortable fit that will maintain the \\nprotective device in the proper position. Particular care should be taken in fitting devices for eye \\nprotection against dust and chemical splash to ensure that the devices are sealed to the face.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023113 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nD. Cleaning and Maintenance\\n1. It is important that all PPE be kept clean and properly maintained. Cleaning is particularly \\nimportant for eye and face protection when dirty or fogged lenses could impair vision. PPE \\nshould be inspected, cleaned and maintained at regular intervals so that the PPE provides \\nthe requisite protection. It is also important to ensure that contaminated PPE that cannot be \\nde-contaminated is disposed of in a manner that protects employees from exposure to \\nhazards.\\n2. General Guidelines for Use of Personal Protective Equipment\\na. The following table summarizes PPE requirements at Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air. \\nThis table is a guide and is not intended to be a complete list of when PPE is required. \\nSupervisory personnel should be consulted if an individual is unsure of what PPE is \\nappropriate.\\n6.19.4 Controls\\nA.

Respirator Types\\n1. AAG makes available the following items of protective respirator equipment in small, \\nmedium or large to be utilized by all personnel when involved in respirator conditions as \\nindicated.\\nNOTE\\nRespirators or cartridges may not be issued by AAG unless employee has an up-to-date \\nrespirator qualification. Dust masks (disposable masks) used voluntarily by an employee \\nare excluded from the requirements. Refer to Section 6.20.13: \" Voluntary Use of Air-\\nPurifying Respirators \".\\na. Half-face and full-face piece: Respirator chemical cartridges are provided for protection \\nagainst organic vapors, acid gases, ammonia and methyl amine dust, mists and fumes, \\npesticides, highly toxic particulates, asbestos radio nuclides.\\nb. Airline Respirator: An airline respirator is a type of respirator that is supplied air from a \\nsource, independent of the atmosphere the wearer is in, by means of an air hose fed \\nfrom a compressor or bottled air. Grade D breathable air, or air that is certified to be of \\nbreathable quality, must be supplied. Airline respirator hoods at IDD Aerospace are of a \\ncontinuous flow design. Continuous flow respirators always maintain a positive \\npressure, thus minimizing the inleakage of contaminants into the wearer’s breathing \\nzone. Couplings to airline systems shall be incompatible to other gas systems to \\nprevent a worker from connecting to an inappropriate compressed gas source. Airlines \\nshall be limited in length to 300 feet.\\n2. Airline Respirator Requirements and Breathing Air: Airline respirators shall be inspected \\nbefore each use by the wearer. Damaged or dirty hoods shall be replaced. Damaged hoses \\nor connectors shall not be used. Team members shall take damaged equipment out of \\nservice and either discard it or arrange for its repair according to the manufacturer’s \\nspecifications. Consult the Respirator Program Administrator for assistance in arranging for \\nrepairs.\\n3. Odd odors while using airline equipment may indicate defective equipment or contamination \\nof the breathing air supply. Contact the Respirator Program Administrator if a problem is \\nsuspected with the supplied breathing air.\\n4. Breathing air outlets are equipped with warning alarms to indicate contamination with \\ncarbon monoxide. Immediately discontinue use of the airline respirator if a warning alarm \\nsounds. Inform the Respirator Program Administrator of any problem with the carbon \\nmonoxide alarms. Facility breathing air shall be maintained at least ANSI-Type I Grade D-\\nbreathing air standard. The Respirator Program Administrator shall assure that sufficient \\ninspection and testing is done to assure this level of air quality. Compressors that have in-\\nline sorbet beds and filters must be maintained according to the manufacturer’s \\nspecifications.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023118 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.20.7 Change-Out Schedule\\nA. Once cartridges are spent or full, the respirator provides the wearer no protection. Some \\nrespirators may come equipped with an End of Service Life Indicator (ESLI). For those that do \\nnot, the following change-out schedule for cartridges should be followed. When in doubt, change \\nit out!\\nB. Always remember to store your respirator in an airtight bag. Not doing so will reduce the service \\nlife of the cartridge.\\n6.20.8 Respirator Use Rules\\nA. Physical Characteristics\\n1. Hair (stubble, mustache, sideburns, beard, low hairline, and bangs) passing between the \\nface and sealing surface of the respirator are not permitted.\\n2. Hair (mustache, beard) that interferes with the function of respirator valve(s) exhalation or \\ninhalation is not permitted.\\n3. If scars, hollow temples, excessively protruding cheekbones, deep creases in facial skin, \\nthe absence of teeth, dentures, or unusual facial configurations prevent the seal of a \\nrespirator to a wearer’s face, the negatively pressured respirator will not be worn.\\nB. Corrective Lenses\\n1. Contact lenses will not be worn if the risk of eye damage is increased by their use (for \\nexample, half-face respirator use in a lacrymator-rich environment).\\n2. Spectacles having temple bars or straps passing between the sealing surface of a respirator \\nand the wearer’s face are not to be worn. Spectacle frames will be available on request from \\na supervisor.\\n3. A head covering passing between the sealing surface and the wearer’s face is not allowed.\\n4.

The following information must be provided to employees who choose to wear respirators, \\nincluding disposable respirators or masks, for protection against nuisance odors or particulates, \\nbut are not required to wear a respirator according to their job duties or job description or \\nbecause harmful contaminant concentrations may be present. “Nuisance” levels are any \\nairborne concentrations in an employee’s workplace which are below established Permissible \\nExposure Limits.\\nB. Employees who are to wear a half-face or full-face respirator as part of their job duties must:\\n1. Receive medical clearance from a physician or licensed health care provider; and\\n2. Pass annual required training on Respiratory Protection including fit-testing of the \\nrespirator. Both must be documented.\\nC. When employees chose to wear respirators when respirators are not required the employer is \\nresponsible for the following:\\n1. The employer is not responsible for supplying a medical evaluation when an employee uses \\nan air-purifying respirator voluntarily.\\n2. The employer may permit employees to wear their own respirators, if the employer \\ndetermines that use of the respirator will not itself create a hazard.\\n3. It must be an appropriate type of respirator for the chemical and/or physical form of the \\ncontaminant.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023121 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n4. If the employer decides to allow the employee to voluntarily use a respirator the employee \\nmust be provided with the information included in Section 6.20.13: \" Voluntary Use of Air-\\nPurifying Respirators \" of this program.\\n5. If airline respirators or a self-contained breathing apparatus are used, the Respiratory \\nProtection Program must be adhered to in full.\\nD. Employees must be familiar with the following information, contained in Appendix D of Section \\n1910.134 of the OSHA regulations:\\n1. Mandatory Information for Employees Using Respirators When Not Required Under the \\nStandard\\na. Respirators are an effective method of protection against designated hazards when \\nproperly selected and worn. Respirator use is encouraged, even when exposures are \\nbelow the exposure limit, to provide an additional level of comfort and protection for \\nworkers. However, if a respirator is used improperly or not kept clean, the respirator \\nitself can become a hazard to the worker. Sometimes, workers may wear respirators to \\navoid exposures to hazards, even if the amount of hazardous substance does not \\nexceed the limits set by OSHA standards. You must take certain precautions to be sure \\nthat the respirator itself does not present a hazard.\\nb. You should do the following:\\n1) Read and heed all instructions provided by the manufacturer on use, maintenance, \\ncleaning and care, and warnings regarding the respirators limitations.\\n2) Choose respirators certified for use to protect against the contaminant of concern. \\nNIOSH, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, certifies \\nrespirators. A label or statement of certification should appear on the respirator or \\nrespirator packaging. It will tell you what the respirator is designed for and how \\nmuch it will protect you.\\n3) Do not wear your respirator into atmospheres containing contaminants for which \\nyour respirator is not designed to protect against. For example, a respirator \\ndesigned to filter dust particles will not protect you against gases, vapors, or very \\nsmall solid particles of fumes or smoke.\\n4) You must keep track of your respirator so that you do not mistakenly use someone \\nelse’s respirator.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023122 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n2. Voluntary use of Respirators\\na. To Respirator Wearer,\\n1) There is a 1998 OSHA Respirator standard that addresses voluntary uses of \\nrespirators and filtering face pieces (dust masks). In the next few paragraphs I \\nhope to explain some key points in dust mask use and care. This is for voluntary \\nuse of a respirator only. Approval of use for this respirator does not give you \\npermission to wear any other type of respirator identified in Horizon’s respiratory \\nprotection written program.\\n2) Respirators/dust masks are an effective method of protection against designated \\nhazards when properly selected and worn. Respirator use is allowed even when \\nexposures are below the exposure limits, to provide an additional level of comfort \\nand protection for workers. However, if a respirator is used improperly or not kept \\nclean, the respirator itself can become a hazard to the worker. Sometimes, \\nworkers may wear respirators to avoid exposures to hazards, even if the amount of \\nhazardous substances does not exceed the limits set by OSHA standards. If your \\nemployer provides respirators for your use, or if you provide your own respirator, \\nyou need to take certain precautions to be sure that the respirator itself does not \\npresent a hazard.\\n3) You should do the following:\\na) Read and follow all instructions provided by the manufacturer on use, \\nmaintenance, cleaning and care and warnings regarding the respirators \\nlimitations.\\nb) Choose respirators certified for use to protect against the contamination of \\nconcern. The Company must provide the respirator/dust mask and it must be \\ncertified by NIOSH (have 2 straps and have a correct NIOSH approval rating \\nnumber). A label statement of certification should appear on the respirator \\npackage. It will tell you what the respirator is designed for and how much it will \\nprotect you.\\nc) Do not wear your respirator/dust mask into atmospheres containing \\ncontaminants for which your respirator is not designed to protect against. For \\nexample, a respirator designed to filter dust particles will not protect you \\nagainst gases, vapors, or very small solid particles of fumes or smoke.\\nd) Discard your respirator when breathing through it becomes labored and \\nobtain a new one.\\ne) Keep track of your respirator so that you do not mistakenly use someone \\nelse’s respirator/dust mask.\\nf) Please return the attached for verifying you good health and understanding of \\nthis requirement to allow you to voluntarily wear a respirator.\\n4) It is your responsibility to notify your supervisor any time a change in your physical \\nhealth occurs which may require a medical examination for approval of dust mask \\nuse.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023123 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nE. Voluntary Respirator Authorization Form\\n6.20.14 Fit Test\\nA. Fit Test Policy\\n1. Because good, reliable, quantitative fit testing for single use respirators (that is, disposable \\ndust mask) is not available, AAG will not use single use respirators when a respirator is \\nrequired. If an employee requests a single use respirator for comfort the respirator can be \\nused on a voluntary basis, that is, only when the exposure to airborne contaminants is \\nbelow the permissible exposure limits. None of the requirements of this program apply \\nwhen a single use respirator (disposable dust mask) is used on a voluntary basis. Refer to \\nSection 6.20.13: \" Voluntary Use of Air-Purifying Respirators \" A for voluntary uses of \\nrespirators.\\n2. If the exposure to airborne contaminants is above the permissible exposure limits, a \\nminimum of a half-face respirator with an air-filtering cartridge will be worn. Each respirator \\nwearer using an air purifying respirator with cartridges shall be fit tested before initial use \\nand annually thereafter or when there has been a weight loss or gain, loss of teeth, or other \\nphysical change reported by the employee or the PLHCP (Physician or Licensed Health \\nCare Professional) that may affect respirator fit.\\nB. Respiratory Protection Factors\\n1. The fit test shall be administered using the qualitative fit-test protocol contained in this \\nsection. After being qualitatively fit tested, half-face respirators will have a protection factor \\nequal to 10, and full-face respirators a protection factor of 100. If a greater protection factor \\nis needed, quantitative fit testing will be performed using protocols acceptable to the State \\nand Federal authorities.\\n2. If a proper fit cannot be achieved, the employee will be given an opportunity to obtain a \\nrespirator from a different manufacturer and be retested.Voluntary Respirator Authorization Form\\nThis notice is to verify that I have no known respiratory or physical health conditions that would prevent me from \\nwearing a voluntary use respirator.\\nEmployee Signature: ________________________________________________________________\\nSupervisor Signature: ________________________________________________________________\\nDate: ________________________________________________________________Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023124 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nC. Qualitative Fit Test Protocol Using Irritant Smoke\\n1. Each employee shall be allowed to choose the most comfortable respirator from a selection \\nof various respirators.\\n2. Prior to selecting a respirator, the employee shall be shown how to properly wear and care \\nfor the respirator, and how to determine when it is time for a new respirator.\\n3. The fit tests shall be performed in a ventilated area away from other employees. Irritant \\nsmoke shall be used as the test agent. To perform fit-testing use NORTH Fit Test Ampules, \\npart #7002, and NORTH Fit Test Irritant Smoke, part #501. The Respiratory Program \\nAdministrator must approve substitution of either product.\\n4. Fit Test Protocol:\\na. Have the employee put the respirator on and perform a positive and negative fit check \\nto good facial seal. \\nb. Inform the employee that the smoke can be irritating to the eyes and they may wish to \\nkeep them closed during the test.\\nc. Break both ends off the smoke tube and attach the rubber bulb to one end and a short \\npiece of rubber tubing to the other end to avoid accidental contact with the sharp glass. \\n(You can also cut the tip off of a cap for the smoke tube instead of using rubber tubing.)\\nd. Gently squeeze the rubber bulb, directing the smoke toward the respirator face seal of \\nthe employee or in such a manner that air currents pull the smoke through the \\nbreathing zone.\\ne. You may need to squeeze the bulb several times throughout the exercise regime,\\nf. Have the employee do the following exercises:\\n1) Breathe normally.\\n2) Take 3 deep breaths.\\n3) Turn head from shoulder to shoulder.\\n4) Nod head up and down.\\n5) Have employee talk (either count to 40, recite the alphabet or repeat the “Rainbow \\nPassage” after you)Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023125 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6) The Rainbow Passage\\na) “When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, it acts like a prism and forms a \\nrainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. \\nThese take the shape of a long, round arch with its path high above and its 2 \\nends apparently beyond the horizon. There is according to legend, a boiling \\npot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man \\nlooks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot \\nof gold at the end of the rainbow.”\\n7) Make facial expressions: smile, yawn, squint, frown, and chew.\\n8) Breathe normally.\\ng. If during the exercises the employee indicates that they detect the irritant smoke, \\nshould immediately stop the test. Readjust or replace the respirator and retest. Try a \\ndifferent respirator if the employee is able to detect the smoke after several tests.\\nh. A record shall be kept of each fit test and shall include:\\n1) Type of respirator-fitting test used.\\n2) Specific make and model of the respirator tested.\\n3) Name of the person tested.\\n4) Name of the Tester.\\n5) Date of the test.\\n6) Test results.\\nD. Task List for Required or Recommended Respirator Use\\n1. Some tasks performed by AAG employees require respiratory protection based on previous \\nair sampling that have shown contaminant concentrations that approach or exceed \\npermissible exposure limits. Respiratory protection is required for other tasks due to their \\nparticular non-uniformity of hazardous conditions although previous air sampling may have \\nshown contaminant levels to be safe.\\n2. Required Respirator Usage for Select Tasks:\\na. Fuel Tank Entry.\\nb. HAZWOPER response as indicated by the MSDS/SDS.\\nc. Welding items that cannot be placed directly in front of a local exhaust duct.\\nd. Spray painting large items or large areas of an aircraft such as white tailing a plane.\\ne. Spray painting or brush painting in confined areas that do not have local exhaust or \\nsupplemental ventilation (inside cabinets on an aircraft or painting inside one of the \\n“confined spaces” on an aircraft).\\nf. Using cleaning solvents in a confined area that does not have local exhaust or \\nsupplemental ventilation (same as above).Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023126 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n3. Many activities that involve the use of hazardous materials are performed for short periods \\nof time and/or have good exhaust ventilation in the area. In these instances, the permissible \\nexposure limits should not be exceeded. However, air sampling and testing is the only way \\nto confirm that contaminant levels are below regulatory limits. Tasks that match the \\nfollowing general descriptions are good candidates for additional evaluation if air sampling \\nhas not been previously performed. Inform the Safety Department if you believe no data \\nexists for a particular task described in the following:\\na. Work that produces an oil mist or particulates that may be inhaled.\\nb. Hazardous waste compacting and pouring.\\nc. A non-routine task where there is a possibility that an unexpected exposure may occur.\\n4. Any employee who suspects that contaminant levels may be approaching regulatory limits \\nfor a task they are performing where respiratory protection is not required should contact \\nthe Airport Operations Safety department.\\n6.20.15 Respirator Use Monitoring Checklist\\nA.

The purpose of the Temperature Protection Program is to provide protection guidance for \\nemployees who may be exposed to temperature extremes due to various work activities. This \\nwill be accomplished through evaluations of work loads, training, and minimizing exposures \\nthrough engineering and administrative controls, as well as PPE usage. This program will also \\noutline monitoring systems to evaluate temperature exposure potentials of affected employees.\\nB. The policy of AAG is to minimize the effects of overexposure due to temperature extremes while \\nconducting normal work activities. This will include educating employees on symptoms of \\noverexposure, monitoring activities, as well as exposure minimization efforts.\\n6.23.1 Definitions\\nA.Heat  – Measure of energy in terms of quantity\\nB.Calorie  – Amount of heat required to raise 1 gram of water 1° C (based on a standard \\ntemperature of 16.5 to 17.5° C).\\nC.Conduction  – Transfer of heat between materials that contact each other. Heat passes from the \\nwarmer material to the cooler material. As an example, a worker’s skin transfers heat to a \\ncontacting surface if that surface is cooler, and vice versa.\\nD.Convection  – Transfer of heat in a moving fluid or media. Air flowing past the body can cool the \\nbody if the air temperature is cooler than the surface temperature of the worker’s skin.\\nE.Evaporative Cooling  – Occurs when sweat evaporates from the skin. Humidity can reduce or \\nincrease rate of evaporation.\\nF.Radiation  – Transfer of heat energy through space. For example, a worker whose body \\ntemperature is grater than the temperature of the surrounding surfaces radiates heat to these \\nsurfaces.\\nG.Globe temperature  – Measurement of temperature inside a blackened, hollow, thin copper \\nglobe that measures radiant heat in surrounding space.\\nH.Metabolic Heat  – A by-product of the body’s activity.\\nI.Natural Wet Bulb (NWB) Temperature  – Measurement of temperature by exposing a wet \\nsensor, such as a wet cotton wick fitted over the bulb of a thermometer, to the effects of \\nevaporation and convection. The term natural refers to the movement of air around the sensor.\\nJ.Dry Bulb (DB) Temperature  – Measurement of temperature by a thermal sensor, such as an \\nordinary mercury in glass thermometer, that is shielded from direct radiant energy sources.\\nK.Ambient – Temperature in the immediate surrounding area (less environmental factors such as \\nwind).Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023134 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.23.2 Responsibilities\\nA. Management\\n1. Ensure training is completed for areas of responsibility.\\n2. Evaluate environments for temperature extremes and associated hazards.\\n3. Communicate all related policies and procedures for reducing exposure to temperature \\nextremes.\\nB. Supervisors\\n1. Ensure employees are properly trained in aspects of temperature extreme protection.\\nC. Employees\\n1. Follow established procedures and rules regarding protection from temperature extremes.\\n2. Immediately report any symptoms of adverse health due to exposure to temperature \\nextremes.\\n6.23.3 Temperature Effects\\nA. Effects of temperature exposure will vary greatly from one person to another. Age, weight, \\ndegree of physical fitness, degree of acclimatization, metabolism, use of alcohol or drugs, and a \\nvariety of medical conditions will affect a person’s sensitivity to temperature exposures. In \\naddition, environmental factors other than ambient air temperature will affect an employee’s \\nsusceptibility. Radiant energy sources, air movement, conduction, and relative humidity all affect \\nan individual’s response to temperature exposures. Both hot and cold temperatures present \\nunique hazards and challenges.\\nB. Heat\\n1. Overexposure to heat can cause a number of related conditions from minor to life \\nthreatening.\\n2. Heat Stress is the net heat load to which an employee may be exposed from the combined \\ncontributions of physical demands of the work as well as environmental factors. An \\nemployee’s acclimation to this exposure also plays as a factor.\\n3. Heat Rashes are the most common symptom in hot work environments. These rashes \\nappear as red papules or bumps on the skin and usually occur where clothing is restrictive. \\nThere is a prickly sensation of the area due to increased sweating.\\n4. A Sunburn is a form of a heat rash and may need medical attention depending on severity.\\n5. Heat Strain/Fatigue is the body’s overall response to elevated heat stress. This is usually \\ndue to a lack of acclimation to the exposed temperature. Signs and symptoms include \\nimpaired performance of skilled mental, sensorimotor, or vigilant jobs. There is no treatment \\nexcept to remove the heat stress before a more serious condition develops.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023135 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6. Heat Cramps are usually caused by performing hard, physical labor in a hot environment. \\nThese cramps are credited to an electrolyte imbalance caused by sweating. These cramps \\ncan be caused by both excess and too little salt.\\n7. Heat Collapse (fainting) occurs when the brain does not receive enough oxygen because \\nblood has “pooled” in the extremities. This occurs as the body moves more blood to the \\nremote areas as an attempt to cool itself. This reaction is similar to that of heat exhaustion \\nand does not affect the body’s heat balance. However, onset of this is rapid and \\nunpredictable. Acclimation is key to prevent heat collapse from occurring.\\n8. Heat Exhaustion symptoms include headache, nausea, vertigo, weakness, thirst, and \\ngiddiness. Fainting can also occur, and poses a risk if the employee is operating equipment. \\nThe affected individual should be removed from the hot environment and given fluid \\nreplacement. Even though symptoms can be treated relatively easily and recovery is likely, \\nheat exhaustion should not be taken lightly, as signs and symptoms of heat stroke are \\nsimilar; however, it is a medical emergency requiring professional attention.\\n9. Heat Stroke occurs when the body’s system of temperature regulation fails and the core \\ntemperature rises to critical levels. This condition is caused from a combination of variable \\nfactors and its occurrence is very difficult to predict. This condition is a medical emergency  \\nand requires immediate professional assistance. Primary symptoms include confusion, \\nirrational behavior, loss of consciousness (not fainting), convulsions, lack of sweating \\n(usually), hot, dry skin, and abnormally high body temperature.\\na. If a worker shows symptoms of possible heat stroke, professional medical attention \\nshould be sought immediately.\\nb. The employee should be removed from the hot environment and placed in a shady \\narea and outer clothing should be removed. Consideration of privacy may not be a \\npossibility dependant on location and treatment is required immediately.\\nc. The skin should be wetted, and air movement around the worker should be increased \\nto improve evaporative cooling until professional assistance arrives. Fluids should be \\nreplaced as soon as possible; however, the affected individual should only sip fluids.\\nd. The employee should not be left unattended or sent home until a Professionally \\nLicensed Health Care Professional (PLHCP) has specifically approved such action.\\nC. Cold\\n1. Cold air, water, and snow all draw heat from the body, and when the body is unable to warm \\nitself, cold related stress may result. Four factors contribute to cold stress: cold air \\ntemperatures, high velocity air movement, dampness of the air, and contact with cold water \\nor surfaces.\\n2. A cold environment forces the body to work harder to maintain its temperature. Over time, \\nthe body will begin to shift blood flow from extremities (hands, feet, arms, and legs) and \\nouter skin to the core (chest and abdomen). This allows exposed skin and the extremities to \\ncool rapidly and increases the risk of hypothermia, frostnip, frostbite or chilblains (each is \\ndescribed below).Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023136 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n3. Wind chill is the combination of air temperature and wind speed and can result in the body \\nbeing exposed temperatures greater than the ambient air temperature. For example, when \\nthe air temperature is 40º F, and the wind speed is 35 mph, skin is exposed to conditions \\nequivalent to the air temperature being about 11º F (see the National Weather Service \\n(NWS) Windchill Chart below for º F conversions). While it is obvious that below freezing \\nconditions combined with inadequate clothing could bring about cold stress, it is also \\nimportant to understand that it can also be brought about by temperatures in the 50’s \\ncoupled with some rain and wind.\\nFigure 6-17: NWS Windchill Chart\\n4. Hypothermia, which means “low heat,” is a potentially serious health condition that occurs \\nwhen the body cannot maintain a core body temperature above 98.6 º F. Hypothermia can \\ntake a victim by surprise since it can occur above freezing. Wind, physical exhaustion, and \\nwet clothing all make a person more prone to hypothermia. Air temperature alone is not \\nenough to judge the cold hazard of an environment, as most cases of hypothermia develop \\nin air temperatures of 36 º F to 50 º F (combined with rain or wind). The following are \\nsymptoms of hypothermia:\\na. Numbness, stiffness or pain (especially in the neck, arms, and legs)\\nb. Poor coordination, slurred speech and drowsiness\\nc. Slow, irregular breathing and heart beat/pulse\\nd. Puffiness in the face\\nRev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023137 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\ne. Low blood pressure\\nf. Listlessness, confusion and disorientation\\ng. Collapse or exhaustion after rest\\nh. Severe shivering\\ni. Unconsciousness and possible death\\n5. Treatment depends on the severity of the hypothermia. If the hypothermia is mild \\n(numbness, stiffness, poor coordination, etc.), move to a warm area and stay active. \\nRemove wet clothes and replace with dry clothes or blankets and cover the head. To \\npromote metabolism and assist in raising internal core temperature, drink a warm (not hot) \\nsugary drink. Avoid drinks with caffeine or alcohol. For more severe cases, hospital \\ntreatment may be required.\\n6. Frostnip occurs when the face or extremities are exposed to cold wind which caused the \\nskin to turn white. The following are symptoms of frostnip:\\na. Firm, cold, white areas on the face, ears, or extremities\\nb. Peeling or blistering that may appear similar to sunburn\\nc. Mild hypersensitivity to cold that persists\\n7. Frostnip should be treated by rewarming the area with an unaffected hand or a warm object. \\nDo not use hot water.\\n8. Frostbite occurs when there is freezing of the skin. It can occur without hypothermia when \\nthe extremities do not receive sufficient heat from central body stores because of \\ninadequate clothing or circulation. The most vulnerable parts of the body are the nose, \\ncheeks, ears, fingers and the toes. Damage from frostbite can be serious: scarring, tissue \\ndeath, amputation or permanent loss of movement in the affected parts, are all possible.\\n9. Skin will not freeze in an air temperature of 30 º F or greater, but there is a danger of \\nhypothermia. As wind velocity increases, heat loss is greater and frostbite will occur more \\nrapidly. If skin should come in contact with objects colder than freezing, frostbite may \\ndevelop at the point of contact, even in a warm environment. The following are symptoms of \\nfrostbite:\\na. The area is cold, tingling, stinging or aching followed by numbness\\nb. Skin color turns red, then purple, then white, and is cold to the touch\\nc. On warming, the area becomes blotchy red, swollen and painful\\nd. Depending on the extent of the injury, the area may recover normally or deteriorate to \\ngangrene\\n10. Treat frostbite by moving the individual to a warm area, removing wet or restrictive clothing \\nor jewelry, and wrapping the affected area in a soft dry cloth or blanket. Contact medical \\npersonnel immediately. Do not treat frostbite by pouring hot water on the affected area or \\nrubbing the area to keep it warm, as this may cause severe tissue damage. Additionally, do \\nnot place the affected part near anything “hot” (heat lamp, hot stove, etc.).Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023138 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n11. Chillblains are caused by prolonged, continuous exposure to cold without freezing, \\ncombined with persistent dampness or actual immersion in water. When this affects the \\nfeet, it is called “trenchfoot”. The following are symptoms of chillblains:\\na. Pale, clammy cold skin that is swollen and numb\\nb. Tingling, itching and burning sensation\\nc. Possible blistering and tissue death\\n12. Chillblains should be treated by moving the individual to a warm, dry area, removing wet or \\nrestrictive clothing or jewelry, and wrapping the affected area in a soft dry cloth or blanket. If \\nit is the feet that are affected, soak the feet in warm (not hot) water and then wrap them in a \\ndry cloth or blanket. Contact medical personnel immediately. Do not treat chillblains by \\npouring hot water on the affected area or rubbing the area to keep it warm, as this may \\ncause severe tissue damage. Additionally, do not place the affected part near anything “hot” \\n(heat lamp, hot stove, etc.).\\n13. Cold Weather Preventive Measures. Plan for work in cold weather by wearing appropriate \\nclothing and being aware of how the body reacts to the cold. Cotton loses its insulation \\nvalue when wet, while wool, silk and most synthetics retain their insulation value even when \\nwet. The following are recommendations for working in cold environments:\\na. Below 40 º F wear adequate insulating, dry clothing and gloves to maintain body core \\ntemperatures above 98.6 º F. Heavy gloves or mittens should be worn when the air \\ntemperature is 0 º F or less.\\nb. Do not wear restrictive garments. Instead, wear layers of clothing: wool, silk or \\nsynthetic to keep moisture away from the body and provide insulation even when wet.\\nc. Clothing should resist rain and wind but also allow water vapor generated by \\nperspiration to escape.\\nd. Wear a face mask and/or scarf if it is windy or extremely cold and cover your mouth to \\nprotect your lungs.\\ne. Wear a warm hat or hood. Up to 40% of body heat can be lost when the head is left \\nexposed.\\nf. Wear insulated boots or other footwear.\\ng. Keep a change of dry clothing available in case work clothes become wet.\\nh. Use insulating material (gloves, etc.) on equipment handles, especially metal handles, \\nwhen temperatures drop below 30 º F.\\n14. Drink plenty of liquids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol. It is each to become dehydrated in \\ncold weather. If possible, heavy work should be scheduled during the warmer parts of the \\nday. Take breaks out of the cold. Try to work in pairs and keep an eye on each other and \\nwatch for signs of cold stress. Supervisors, workers and coworkers should watch for signs \\nof cold stress and individuals should talk to their Supervisors if the cold has become \\nextremely uncomfortable. When working in cold stress conditions, Supervisors should \\nensure work schedules allow appropriate warm up periods and liquids are available.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023139 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n6.23.4 Work Load Assessments\\nA. Job classifications will be evaluated to determine the work load of that position. This will assist in \\ndetermining potential opportunities for improvement of protection. Various sampling methods \\nmay be used to determine work load. Environmental heat measurements will be made to assist \\nin determining this. They will be made as close to the employee as reasonably possible. Wet \\nBulb Globe Temperature Index may also be used to help determine area exposure and \\nrecommendations.\\nB. In cold weather, evaluations will be made on a case by case basis to determine warm up breaks \\nneeded for employees.\\n6.23.5 Controls\\nA. Engineering Controls\\n1. Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air will utilize engineering controls when feasible to minimize \\noverexposure to the elements. Following are various engineering controls that may be \\nconsidered:\\na. General Ventilation\\n1) This is a technique where air is diluted with other/external air. Normally cooler \\noutside air is introduced to a warmer environment.\\nb. Air cooling/treatment\\n1) Differs from ventilation in that heat is removed from the air, rather than bringing in \\nair\\nc. Air conditioning\\n1) A method of air cooling by mechanically cooling air and introducing it into a warm \\nenvironment\\nd. Local air cooling\\n1) Two options exist: One where cool rooms can be provided as a recovery area. \\nSecondly, a portable air conditioning/blower unit can be used for localized air \\ncooling\\ne. Convection\\n1) The most popular control. Fans, etc. can be used to increase air flow in the area \\nand thus, increasing rate of skin evaporation. In order for this to occur, the air \\ntemperature must be less than worker’s skin temperature\\nf. Conduction\\n1) Insulates the hot surface from conducting heat into the air\\ng. Shielding\\n1) Can be used to reduce radiant heat similarly to conduction protectionRev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023140 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nB. Administrative Controls\\n1. Administrative controls may also be used in conjunction with, or in lieu of, engineering \\ncontrols. These will be a secondary choice behind engineering controls, however, they \\nshould be as effective as engineering controls. The following administrative controls may be \\nprovided to minimize exposures to extreme environments:\\na. Uniform usage\\n1) AAG provides and encourages use of various uniforms during the different \\nseasons. During the summer months, short sleeved, cotton shirts are provided, as \\nwell as shorts are allowed to be worn.\\n2) During winter months, insulating outside layers will be required when temperatures \\nthreaten employee safety.\\nb. Education/knowledge\\n1) Training and education is potentially the most important piece to avoiding adverse \\nconditions associated with element exposure.\\n2) Employee’s are provided information that covers the following:\\na) Recognition of symptoms, predisposing factors\\nb) Knowledge of hazards of exposure\\nc) Employee responsibilities\\nd) Protective clothing\\ne) Hazardous behaviors that increase dangerous factors\\nc. Recognition\\n1) Employees will be knowledgeable of how to recognize signs and symptoms of \\noverexposure to hot or cold environments.\\nd. Responsibilities\\n1) Management\\na) To provide information outlined in the training program above.\\nb) To ensure employees follow set policies and rules surrounding protection from \\noverexposure\\n2) Employees\\na) To understand education provided.\\nb) Follow all set rules and policies\\nc) Report any signs or symptoms of overexposure to a supervisor as soon as \\nthey occur.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023141 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n3) Policies\\na) Policies will be set in order to protect employee exposure to excessive heat \\nand cold in accordance to recommended guidelines set by various agencies \\nsuch as NIOSH and/or ACGIH.\\n4) Rest periods/Job Rotation\\na) When possible, job rotation and/or increased rest periods may be utilized in \\norder to reduce employee exposure to elements and extreme environments.\\n5) Drinking Water\\na) One quart per hour per employee will be readily available during ramp \\noperations when hazardous temperatures exist\\nC. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)\\n1. PPE can also be utilized in addition to engineering and/or administrative controls. This type \\nof protection will be consideration when other methods of hazard minimization are not \\npractical or feasible.\\n2. Reflective Clothing\\na. This type of clothing prevents a person’s skin from absorbing radiant heat. Due to the \\ntype of garments these are, auxiliary cooling systems may be needed in addition to the \\nclothing\\n3. Auxiliary body cooling/clothing\\na. There are various types of cooling systems/clothes that will reduce exposure to \\nelements through different methods. Ice vests are available that allow ice packs to be \\ninserted into specially designed pockets. Others have a cold water system that has \\nwater cycle through as a cooling method. Wetting clothing is a simple technique that \\nmay be used in addition to one of the other systems.\\n4. Overcoats\\na. Various types of over coats will be provided in extreme weather stations to minimize \\nemployees’ exposure to cold stress.\\n6.23.6 Wildfire Air Quality Protocols\\nA. Purpose\\n1. Wildfire smoke can be unpredictable and affect air quality in communities across large \\nareas.\\n2. This protocol sheet is to provide education and guidance for local leadership in determining \\nactions when air quality levels deteriorate in a specific station.\\nB. Definitions\\n1. Air Quality Index (AQI) - Table 1 - A value scale from 0 to 500 that represents the level of air \\npollution in the air. The higher the AQI value, the greater the health concern.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023142 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n2. AQI Time Weighted Average (TWA) - Table 2 - A calculated time employees are allowed per \\nshift to work outside in the environment with associated AQI value. Note: This is an internal \\ncompany requirement and calculation with no regulatory jurisdictions.\\n3. Respirator - In this document, only an N95 (or similar rating) mask, also known as a filtering \\nfacepiece. For purposes of this protocol, the respirators are be for voluntary use only, and \\nnot a requirement. We cannot require mandatory employee use of respirators for wildfire \\nsmoke without a physician\\'s approval and other specialized training and hygiene activities.\\nC. Health Effects of Wildfire Smoke\\n1. There are many hazardous chemicals in wildfire smoke, but the main potential harmful \\npollutant is particulate matter that is suspended in the air.\\n2. These can cause symptoms and complications in individuals.\\na. Irritate lungs causing coughing, phlegm, wheezing, or difficulty breathing\\nb. More seriously, bronchitis, worsening of asthma, heart complications\\n3. Those who are sensitive to, or at higher risk of complications from wildfire smoke include \\nthose with preexisting health conditions, increased duration of exposure, and work resulting \\nin increased breathing rates. These include:\\na. People with lung diseases, such as asthma, COPD\\nb. People who smoke\\nc. People with respiratory infections\\nd. People with heart or circulatory problems\\n4. Any employee showing symptoms of wildfire smoke exposure must be removed from the \\nenvironment and recommended to seek medical treatment if desired.\\na.

This is for voluntary use of a respirator only. Approval of use for this respirator does not \\ngive you permission to wear any other type of respirator. In compliance with OSHA regulations \\nregarding voluntary use of respirators, the following language below must be provided to employees \\nwho choose to voluntarily wear a filtering face piece at the time they receive the mask. \\nRespirators/dust masks are an effective method of protection against designated hazards when \\nproperly selected and worn. Respirator use is allowed even when exposures are below the exposure \\nlimits, to provide an additional level of comfort and protection for workers. However, if a respirator is \\nused improperly or not kept clean, the respirator itself can become a hazard to the worker. \\nSometimes, workers may wear respirators to avoid exposures to hazards, even if the amount of \\nhazardous substances does not exceed the limits set by OSHA standards. If your employer provides \\nrespirators for your use, or if you provide your own respirator, you need to take certain precautions to \\nbe sure that the respirator itself does not present a hazard.\\n \\nYou should do the following:\\n• Read and follow all instructions provided by the manufacturer on use, maintenance, cleaning \\nand care and warnings regarding the respirator\\'s limitations.\\n• Choose respirators certified for use to protect against the contamination of concern. The \\nCompany must provide the respirator/dust mask and it must be certified by NIOSH (have 2 \\nstraps and have a correct NIOSH approval rating number). A label statement of certification \\nshould appear on the respirator package. It will tell you what the respirator is designed for and \\nhow much it will protect you. \\n• Do not wear your respirator/dust mask into atmospheres containing contaminants for which your \\nrespirator is not designed to protect against. For example, a respirator designed to filter dust \\nparticles will not protect you against gases, vapors, or very small solid particles of fumes or \\nsmoke.\\n• Discard your respirator when breathing through it becomes labored and obtain a new one. \\n• Keep track of your respirator so that you do not mistakenly use someone else\\'s respirator/dust \\nmask.\\nAdditional information:\\nWhen not in use, please store your respirator in a clean, dry location such as a plastic bag, or locker.\\nFiltering facepieces are normally able to be used for 8-10 hours of continuous use, or until they \\nbecome saturated or hard to breathe through. Always refer to the manufacturer\\'s recommendations \\nor your Supervisor if you have questions.Rev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023148 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nRemember: It is your responsibility to notify your supervisor any time you feel you cannot safely \\nwear an N95 or other filtering facepiece for any reason.\\n6.23.7 Training and Education\\nA.

At Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, we may face situations when we find ourselves working \\noutdoors in hot environments. When the body is unable to cool itself by sweating, several \\nheat-induced illnesses can occur, even leading to death. Without treatment, heat related \\nillnesses can progress quickly and will vary among individuals, dependant on several \\npersonal factors such as age, weight, fitness level, use of medications and alcohol, medical \\nconditions, and acclimation to the environment. All of these affect how well the body deals \\nwith excess heat.\\n2. It is important to know the symptoms of heat-related illnesses and that they can progress \\nleading to a life threatening situation. These include:\\nB. Heat Rashes\\n1. Most common symptom\\n2.

Protecting employees from extreme heat hazards\\n1. At Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, there are several situations when employees must work \\noutdoors in hot environments. Without treatment, heat related illnesses can progress \\nquickly and will vary among individuals, dependant on several issues.\\nC. Personal Factors\\n1. All of the following affect how well the body deals with excess heat and can reduce a \\nperson’s tolerance to a hot environment.\\na. Age – Older people (>65 years old) can be more susceptible to heat illnesses. This is \\nalso largely dependant on other personal factors\\nb. Obesity – Body fat does not conduct heat as well as muscle, thereby not cooling as \\nquickly and causing body temperature to remain at elevated levels. The more obese a \\nperson, the greater at risk they may be.\\nc. Hydration – This is one of the most influential factors for preventing a heat related \\nillness. Dehydration seriously limits and endangers successful adjustments to heat. A \\nperson needs to drink approximately one quart of water per hour to replace lost fluids.\\nd. Medication/Recreational Drugs – Many prescription and some over the counter drugs \\nneed to be used with extra caution in hot environments. Examples of how drugs can \\naffect a person are; inhibiting sweating, increasing body temperature, affect thirst, and \\neven reduce a body’s ability to regulate its temperature. Alcohol use, even in low \\namounts, will greatly affect ability to regulate body temperature.\\ne. Gender – There appears to be no apparent difference in reactions to heat between \\nmen and women, and other personal factors outweigh this difference.\\nf. Acclimation – This is another important factor in a person’s ability to work in hot \\nenvironments. It can take a person up to three weeks to become fully acclimated to an \\nenvironment. Normally, a person can become safely acclimated in 5-7 days. Effects of \\nacclimation are often dramatic and can occur quickly in someone not used to the \\nenvironment.\\n2. You must know the different types of heat-related illnesses, symptoms of them, and that \\nthey can progress leading to a life threatening situation. These include:\\na. Heat Rashes\\n1) Most common symptom\\n2) Appear as red bumps on skin – usually where clothing is restrictiveRev. 1-2023\\n6/16/2023151 of 153\\nChapter 6Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n3) May have a “prickly” sensation at site\\nb.

The following sections detail procedures and guidelines to accommodate the wide variety of \\nlocations, environments and, many different hazards and potential for injuries. Each workgroup \\nat each location can consult these guidelines to determine if they are required to have first aid \\ncertified employees, how many, and how to obtain them.\\nB. While this plan addresses a variety of the differing needs, many work areas share many \\ncommon elements. The following apply to the Company work areas:\\n1. Emergency numbers and evacuation assembly areas must be posted in each work area \\nand on or near the first aid station.\\n2. The local emergency service is the primary first aid responder; however employees must be \\ntrained on how and when to report a medical emergency.\\n3. In the absence of an infirmary, clinic, hospital or emergency medical services in near \\nproximity to the workplace a person or persons shall be adequately trained to render first \\naid.\\n4. Airport Facilities: As an option, at airport facilitates work-groups may choose to rely on \\nairport emergency services for primary first aid response instead of maintaining first aid \\ntrained employees in each work-group. Emergency services must be on site and on call \\nduring all hours of operation to use this option. All employees must be informed that the \\nairport emergency services are the primary first aid responders.\\n5. Remote Airport Facilities: When emergency services are not on site or not on call at all \\ntimes, then at least one first aid certified employee must be on site for each work-group at \\nall times.\\n6. Office Building, Facilities, and Training Centers (non-airport locations): If the facility less \\nthan 10 minutes away from emergency medical services that are on call 24-hours a day, the \\nwork group may choose to rely on local emergency services for primary first aid response \\ninstead of maintaining first aid trained employees. If the facility is further than 10 minutes \\nfrom emergency services, then the management of that facility shall ensure compliance \\nwith the first aid training requirements. There must be at least one first aid certified \\nemployee per floor of each building or wing or in another defined work-group at all times \\nthat employees are present. One method of complying is to have a supervisor or lead on \\nevery shift, in every work group first aid trained.\\n7. Dispersed Work Crews: Dispersed work crews who frequently work outside the 5-minute \\nradius from emergency medical service must have a first aid certified employee present at \\nthe work site.\\n8. Working Alone: Employees who work alone (e.g., custodial services, delivery personnel, \\nbuilding facilities personnel) must know how to summon a first aid certified employee and \\nsupervisors/leads must know the location of staff working alone and check on them \\nperiodically.\\n9. Other: If any workgroup has an environment(s) not addressed in this plan, or has a complex \\nmix of environments or locations, consult the building/facilities First Aid Response chart for \\nmore guidance or the Airports and Maintenance Operations Safety Department (SEAZR) \\ncan assist in the development of a specific response plan for your location.Rev. 1-2023\\n4/9/202150 of 53\\nChapter 7Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n7.14.3 Medical Emergency\\nA. In case of medical emergencies including any unconscious person or potential life-threatening \\nemergency, take the following actions:\\n1. Call local emergency medical services (EMS) immediately.

Knowledge of voluntary provisions of first aid consent and confidentiality\\n18. AED (defibrillator) use\\nC. First aid training acquired through other approved providers should be documented in the local \\nemergency plan and the Airport Operations Safety Department (SEAZR).\\nD. First aid and CPR certifications must be updated and tested, including a practical demonstration \\nevery two years to maintain a valid first aid certification.\\nE. Documentation of first aid training: Each employee who completes an AAG sponsored (through \\nAmerican Red Cross) first aid course will receive CPR and first aid card, which serves as \\ndocumentation. First aid trained employees should be identified for each work group. In addition, \\nthe Airports and Maintenance Operations Safety Department (SEAZR), maintains a master \\nrecord of all CPR and first aid trained employees throughout the company (via the American \\nRed Cross database).\\n7.14.5 First Aid Supplies\\nA. First aid supplies must be readily available to all employees and stored in a clean, clearly \\nmarked, unlocked location. Each facility or work-group must develop a list of first aid supplies \\nsuitable to their environment and conditions. Airports and Maintenance Operations Safety can \\nrecommend a basic list of commonly required first aid supplies. However, other items must be \\nadded based on the local work environment and known hazards. The minimum requirements \\nnecessary in kits can be found by contacting Airports and Maintenance Operations Safety at \\n(206) 392-7986.\\nB. Portable kits must also be available if the work area is over 100 yards from the nearest first aid \\nstation.\\nC. Post emergency phone number on the front of the first aid station or on the first aid kit.\\nD. Post the name, location, and phone number of first aid certified employees on first aid kit or \\nwhere first aid supplies are stored.\\n7.14.6 Automatic External Defibrillator (AED)\\nA. AED is an automated device that analyzes heart rhythm, identifies abnormal rhythms requiring \\ndefibrillation, and (with operator assistance), delivers a defibrillating electric shock. The AAG \\nAED Response Plan covers AED units owned and maintained by the Company and housed in \\nbuildings and airports that we serve. Units housed in aircraft do not fall under this plan. Airports \\nand Maintenance Operations Safety owns the AAG AED program. Training can be conducted \\nlive or via a stand alone video.Rev. 1-2023\\n4/9/202152 of 53\\nChapter 7Safety Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\n7.14.7 Good Samaritan Act\\nA. Employees who obtain first aid training to comply with a regulatory requirement do so as a \\ncollateral duty and not as a primary job assignment. Employees who may render first aid to \\nanother employee or customer in the workplace are covered under the Good Samaritan Statute, \\nwhich states in part: Any person who in good faith and not for compensation renders emergency \\ncare at the scene of an emergency or who participates in transporting, not for compensation, \\nthere from an injured person or persons for emergency medical treatment shall not be liable for \\ncivil damages resulting from any act or omission in rendering of such care or transporting such \\npersons, other than acts or omissions constituting gross negligence or willful or wanton \\nmisconduct.\\n7.14.8 Bloodborne Pathogens\\nA. Alaska Airlines/Horizon Air employees who are first aid trained as a collateral duty are not \\nrequired to have annual bloodborne pathogen training nor are they required to be offered the \\nHepatitis B immunization.\\nB. In the event that an employee is exposed to human blood or potentially infectious bodily fluids \\nduring the administration of first aid or other activities in the workplace, the employee shall notify \\ntheir supervisor immediately so that they can be referred to the appropriate health clinic for post \\nexposure follow-up. In addition, an AAG Body Fluid Exposure Report must be completed. More \\ninformation regarding bloodborne pathogen exposures and procedures are found in this manual, \\nrefer to Section 6.5: \" Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan \".\\nC. The first aid training sponsored by Safety Programs includes instruction in universal precautions \\nfor protection against bloodborne pathogens while administering first aid.\\nD. Primary first aid stations at each location should also contain a bloodborne pathogen clean up \\nkit.\\n7.14.9 Controls\\nA.

      "Unacceptable behaviors, illegal activities, or intentional di sregard for regulations, policies, or procedures, are \n",
      "however subject to discipline.\n",

      "b. Analyst reviews the report and generates an event without assigning an Event Level.\n",
      "c. Analyst will immediately contact their SMS Liaison and the appropriate Safety director \n",
      "or manager to trigger an investigation. An investigation will occur by either the \n",
      "operating division or the Safety division.\n",
      "d. Close Call events from the previous week will be reviewed at P-WSR. Events that do \n",
      "not have a completed investigation will be assigned an initial Event Level given current \n",
      "known information.\n",
      "e. Close Call events will be briefed at WSR, SPL, OPL, DAG, and SRB, as applicable.\n",

      "1. The Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) is a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \n",
      "sponsored program designed to collect safety related information from employees and use \n",
      "that information to develop corrective/preventive actions to enhance safety. ASAP utilizes \n",
      "non-punitive incentives to encourage safety event reporting that may otherwise go \n",
      "unreported. This allows corrective actions to be implemented to enhance safety within the \n",
      "operation.\n",
      "2. AAG currently hosts ASAP programs for Pilots, Flight Attendants, Dispatchers, \n",
      "Maintenance Management and Maintenance Technicians. Alaska Airlines Airport \n",
      "Operations employees with union representation (Customer Service, Ramp, Cargo, \n",
      "Operations, Stores Agents, Crew Scheduling, Reservations, Accounting, and Records \n",
      "Specialists) are covered by the Ground Safety Action Program (GSAP), which has the same \n",
      "requirements of the ASAP Program. Each program is governed by a Memorandum of \n",
      "Understanding (MOU) agreed to by the representatives of the FAA, the Company, and \n",
      "employee union (where applicable).\n",
      "3. The ASAP program relies on the understanding and cooperation between the parties \n",
      "involved to function successfully. The MOU is the controlling document for the program and \n",
      "houses the standard operating procedures (SOP) for the workgroups. FAA guidance for \n",
      "ASAP is contained in Advisory Circular 120-66 (as amended), the FAA ASAP website, and \n",
      "directly from AFS-280.\n",
      "4. All ASAP programs are administered by the AAG Safety Division, and specifically by ASAP \n",
      "Specialists and Managers, with the assistance of the SMS Managers (as applicable); this \n",
      "establishes the ASAP Team. The team reports directly to the General Manager SMS and \n",
      "ASAP, who has overall authority of the program.\n",

      "Aviation Regulation (FAR), Federal or State regulations, Company policy or procedure, or \n",
      "anything related to the safety of the operation. Employees may also submit ASAP reports to \n",
      "highlight observed safety concerns.\n",
      "2. Accepted ASAP reports guarantee that, in the event of an FAR violation, no FAA \n",
      "enforcement action will be taken. Accepted ASAP reports also cannot be used by the \n",
      "Company to initiate or support any company discipline. The vast majority of reports are \n",
      "accepted.\n",
      "3. An ASAP report does not substitute for a required irregularity report (MIR, PIR, GIR, FAIR, \n",
      "etc.). In some cases, two reports may be necessary to meet both the Company’s reporting \n",
      "requirements and to take advantage of the protective provisions of ASAP.\n",
      "4. All reports are submitted electronically, via the AAG Safety Reporting System, and each \n",

      "specific statement that the report is being closed, and the basis for closing.\n",
      "b. Concurrence\n",
      "1) Prior to closing an SHR the Safety Representative assigned will contact the \n",
      "submitter (if possible) with an update and the intent to close the report. If the \n",
      "submitter expresses reservations about closing the report prior to a final \n",
      "resolution, those concerns should be noted. If the filer provides additional \n",

      "damage, or accident - but had the potential to do so. Only a fortunate break in the chain of \n",
      "events prevented a negative outcome. Often the words “luck” or “exceptional skill” are said \n",

      "outcome could have resulted in:\n",
      "a. Employee injury (Event Level C-F)\n",

      "c. Property damage (Event Level C-F)\n",
      "d. Regulatory noncompliance (Event Level C-F)\n",
      "2. It is essential to review Close Call events as if the worst credible outcome had occurred. In \n",
      "these events, little to no safety margin remains and the only elements protecting against a \n",
      "negative outcome is “luck” or “exceptional skill”. The following general Close Call process \n",
      "applies:\n",
      "a. Employee submits a safety report which is filtered to the appropriate division for review.\n",
      "b. Analyst reviews the report and generates an event without assigning an Event Level.\n",
      "c. Analyst will immediately contact their SMS Liaison and the appropriate Safety director \n",
      "or manager to trigger an investigation. An investigation will occur by either the \n",
      "operating division or the Safety division.\n",
      "d. Close Call events from the previous week will be reviewed at P-WSR. Events that do \n",
      "not have a completed investigation will be assigned an initial Event Level given current \n",
      "known information.\n",
      "e. Close Call events will be briefed at WSR, SPL, OPL, DAG, and SRB, as applicable.\n",
      "f. After the investigation has concluded, the Event Level will be updated, as applicable.\n",
      "g. All Close Call events will be given a System Assessment at P-WSR, WSR, and/or SPL \n",
      "meetings once the investigation has concluded.\n",
      "h. If the investigation identifies a new hazard, ineffective risk control, or change to policy / \n",
      "procedures, a reactive SRA will be conducted. If the investigation discovers non-\n",
      "compliance and/or non-conformance, a corrective/preventive action will be issued.\n",

      "i. Does the individual’s 72-hour history suggest little sleep, or less sleep \n",
      "than usual?\n",
      "ii. Did the accident occur during times of reduced alertness (such as 0300 \n",

      "Uncompromising Commitment to Safety\n",
      "The safety and well-being of our employees and guests is the foundation of everything we do at Alaska Airlines and \n",
      "Horizon Air, and overrides all other considerations. It is th e basis upon which our success rests. Each employee at every \n",
      "level of the organization is committed, accountable, and has the authority to maintain the highest level of safety for \n",
      "every employee, every customer, every flight, every day.\n",
      "To ensure our core value of safety is never compromised, we are committed to the following:\n",
      "1) We recognize our fundamental obligation is to transpor t our guests and employees safely to their destinations, \n",
      "understanding they entrust their lives to us upon boarding our aircraft. We will always honor this trust, and will \n",
      "never jeopardize safety in the pursuit of other initiatives.\n",
      "2) Our primary safety objective is to identify, monitor, and mi tigate safety risks to as low as reasonably practical. To \n",
      "that end, we will never stop improving and advancing ou r Safety Management System (SMS), and will provide \n",
      "the necessary financial, personnel, and other resources needed to manage safety risk in order to continuously \n",
      "build upon our robust culture of safety.\n",
      "3) We will set and regularly review our safety goals and ob jectives and clearly communicate these to all employees\n",
      "and business partners. Additionally, thes e objectives will be continually moni tored, measured, and tracked, and \n",
      "all levels of management will be responsible to ensure these goals are relevant and achieved.\n",
      "4) We will ensure that all employees and business part ners understand the requirement to report any safety \n",
      "hazard, incident, or concern. Our comprehensive safety  reporting system includes irregularity reporting for all \n",
      "operating divisions, Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) reporting for all front-line workgroups, and the \n",
      "Safety Hazard Report (SHR) or Safety Hotline for reporting directly to the safety division.\n",
      "5) We will ensure that employees know they will never be disciplined for reporting a safety hazard or event.\n",
      "Unacceptable behaviors, illegal activities, or intentional di sregard for regulations, policies, or procedures, are \n",
      "however subject to discipline.\n",
      "6) We will continue to promote the principles of \"Ready, Safe, Go\" and ensure that employees and business \n",
      "partners know they are empowered to stop the operation any time something appears to be unsafe.\n",
      "7) Our response to any emergency will be measured, coor dinated and timely in acco rdance with our emergency \n",

      "1.Responsibility - Who is accountable for management and overall quality of the process \n",
      "(planning, organizing, directing, controlling (and its ultimate accomplishment).\n",
      "2.Authority  - Who can direct, control, or change the process, as well as who can make key \n",
      "decisions such as risk acceptance. This attribute also includes the concept of \n",
      "empowerment.\n",
      "3.Procedures  - International Organization for Standardization (ISO)-9001-2000 defines \n",
      "“procedures” as “a specified way to carry out an activity or a process” - procedures translate \n",
      "the “what” in goals and objectives into how in practical activities (things people do). \n",
      "Procedures are simply documented activities to accomplish processes, e.g., a way to \n",
      "perform a process. The organization should specify their own procedures for accomplishing \n",
      "processes in the context of their unique operational environment, organizational structure, \n",
      "and management objectives. \n",
      "4.Controls  - Controls are elements of the system, including hardware, software, special \n",
      "procedures, or procedural steps, and supervisory practices designed to keep processes on \n",
      "track to achieve their intended results. Organizational process controls are typically defined \n",

      "Many controls are inherent features of the FAA SMS Framework. Practices such as \n",
      "continuous monitoring, internal audits, internal evaluations, and management reviews (all \n",
      "parts of the Safety Assurance (SA) component) are identified as controls within the design \n",
      "expectations. Additionally, other practices such as documentation, process reviews, and \n",
      "data tracking are identified as controls within specific elements and processes.\n",
      "5.Process Measures  - Ways to provide feedback to responsible parties that required actions \n",
      "are taking place, required outputs are being produced, and expected outcomes are being \n",
      "achieved. A basic principle of SA is that fundamental processes be measured so that \n",
      "management decisions can be data-driven. The general expectations for §5, Subpart B, \n",
      "Safety Policy specify that SMS outputs be measured and analyzed. These measurements \n",
      "and analyses are accomplished in 14 CFR Part 5, Subpart D, Safety Assurance. Outputs of \n",

      "3. Closing Criteria\n",
      "a. Due to the possible variations in reports, it is not practical to establish specific criteria to \n",
      "close a report. However, the Safety Representative assigned to an SHR should ensure:\n",
      "1) The specific safety concerns of the report are understood.\n",
      "2) All findings identified in the review have been assessed and communicated for \n",
      "appropriate action.\n",
      "3) All Safety Representative actions relating to the SHR are logged into the Actions \n",
      "Taken section of the SHR. Documentation includes: action item(s), the process \n",
      "owner(s), and date the action was taken.\n",
      "4) When a report is being closed, the activity narrative shall be updated to include a \n",
      "specific statement that the report is being closed, and the basis for closing.\n",
      "b. Concurrence\n",
      "1) Prior to closing an SHR the Safety Representative assigned will contact the \n",
      "submitter (if possible) with an update and the intent to close the report. If the \n",
      "submitter expresses reservations about closing the report prior to a final \n",
      "resolution, those concerns should be noted. If the filer provides additional \n",
      "information that is pertinent to the report, it should not be closed until those \n",
      "concerns are addressed. If no new information is brought forward, the report \n",
      "should be closed.\n",
      "c. Closing Notification\n",
      "1) Once the report is closed, the Safety Representative should send the submitter an \n",
      "email summarizing the review. Findings, recommendations, and actions generated \n",
      "by the review should be identified. The email should address any findings the Rev. 18\n",

      "and SRB.\n",
      "D. Irregularity Report Processing Procedures\n",
      "1. Employee or business partner submits report via the AAG Safety Reporting System or \n",
      "informs station leadership of an event for submission into the system, which is automatically \n",
      "filtered to the appropriate division for review.\n",
      "2. The analyst will review the report and generate an event, to include:\n",
      "a. Correct documentation of all pertinent information\n",

      "4. If the analyst is unsure about an Event Level, they may leave the Event Level unassigned \n",
      "and contact the applicable Safety Manager/Director for assistance or if applicable, flag it for \n",
      "WSR to be assessed cross-divisionally.\n",
      "5. If the report was submitted to the wrong division or needs further action from outside the \n",
      "division (e.g., Security, Environmental, Catering, Fueling, etc.), the report will be sent to the \n",
      "appropriate division for actioning and/or awareness.\n",
      "6. Investigation criteria is based on the division specific Event Response Matrix (ERM) as \n",

      "investigation check-box in the event and follow the notification guidelines documented in \n",
      "the division specific Event Response Matrix. After the investigation process has concluded, \n",
      "the Event Level may be updated to reflect new information, as applicable.\n",
      "7. Analysts should flag the following types of events for discussion at the applicable meeting:\n",
      "a. WSR:\n",
      "1) Event that warrants cross-divisional discussion, not just cross-divisional action\n",
      "2) Close call events\n",

      "E. Close Call Processing Procedures\n",
      "1. A close call is defined as an unplanned event that did not result in an injury, illness, incident, \n",
      "damage, or accident - but had the potential to do so. Only a fortunate break in the chain of \n",
      "events prevented a negative outcome. Often the words “luck” or “exceptional skill” are said \n",
      "to be the only barrier remaining. AAG defines a Close Call where the worst credible \n",
      "outcome could have resulted in:\n",
      "a. Employee injury (Event Level C-F)\n",
      "b. Aircraft damage (Event Level C-F)\n",
      "c. Property damage (Event Level C-F)\n",
      "d. Regulatory noncompliance (Event Level C-F)\n",
      "2. It is essential to review Close Call events as if the worst credible outcome had occurred. In \n",
      "these events, little to no safety margin remains and the only elements protecting against a \n",
      "negative outcome is “luck” or “exceptional skill”. The following general Close Call process \n",
      "applies:\n",
      "a. Employee submits a safety report which is filtered to the appropriate division for review.\n",
      "b. Analyst reviews the report and generates an event without assigning an Event Level.\n",
      "c. Analyst will immediately contact their SMS Liaison and the appropriate Safety director \n",
      "or manager to trigger an investigation. An investigation will occur by either the \n",
      "operating division or the Safety division.\n",
      "d. Close Call events from the previous week will be reviewed at P-WSR. Events that do \n",
      "not have a completed investigation will be assigned an initial Event Level given current \n",
      "known information.\n",
      "e. Close Call events will be briefed at WSR, SPL, OPL, DAG, and SRB, as applicable.\n",
      "f. After the investigation has concluded, the Event Level will be updated, as applicable.\n",
      "g. All Close Call events will be given a System Assessment at P-WSR, WSR, and/or SPL \n",
      "meetings once the investigation has concluded.\n",
      "h. If the investigation identifies a new hazard, ineffective risk control, or change to policy / \n",
      "procedures, a reactive SRA will be conducted. If the investigation discovers non-\n",
      "compliance and/or non-conformance, a corrective/preventive action will be issued.\n",

      "A. Overview\n",
      "1. The Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) is a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \n",
      "sponsored program designed to collect safety related information from employees and use \n",
      "that information to develop corrective/preventive actions to enhance safety. ASAP utilizes \n",
      "non-punitive incentives to encourage safety event reporting that may otherwise go \n",
      "unreported. This allows corrective actions to be implemented to enhance safety within the \n",
      "operation.\n",
      "2. AAG currently hosts ASAP programs for Pilots, Flight Attendants, Dispatchers, \n",
      "Maintenance Management and Maintenance Technicians. Alaska Airlines Airport \n",
      "Operations employees with union representation (Customer Service, Ramp, Cargo, \n",
      "Operations, Stores Agents, Crew Scheduling, Reservations, Accounting, and Records \n",
      "Specialists) are covered by the Ground Safety Action Program (GSAP), which has the same \n",
      "requirements of the ASAP Program. Each program is governed by a Memorandum of \n",
      "Understanding (MOU) agreed to by the representatives of the FAA, the Company, and \n",
      "employee union (where applicable).\n",
      "3. The ASAP program relies on the understanding and cooperation between the parties \n",
      "involved to function successfully. The MOU is the controlling document for the program and \n",
      "houses the standard operating procedures (SOP) for the workgroups. FAA guidance for \n",
      "ASAP is contained in Advisory Circular 120-66 (as amended), the FAA ASAP website, and \n",
      "directly from AFS-280.\n",
      "4. All ASAP programs are administered by the AAG Safety Division, and specifically by ASAP \n",
      "Specialists and Managers, with the assistance of the SMS Managers (as applicable); this \n",
      "establishes the ASAP Team. The team reports directly to the General Manager SMS and \n",
      "ASAP, who has overall authority of the program.\n",

      "1. ASAP is a voluntary program and reports are never required; however, reporting is highly \n",
      "recommended whenever an employee believes that they may have violated a Federal \n",
      "Aviation Regulation (FAR), Federal or State regulations, Company policy or procedure, or \n",
      "anything related to the safety of the operation. Employees may also submit ASAP reports to \n",
      "highlight observed safety concerns.\n",
      "2. Accepted ASAP reports guarantee that, in the event of an FAR violation, no FAA \n",
      "enforcement action will be taken. Accepted ASAP reports also cannot be used by the \n",
      "Company to initiate or support any company discipline. The vast majority of reports are \n",
      "accepted.\n",
      "3. An ASAP report does not substitute for a required irregularity report (MIR, PIR, GIR, FAIR, \n",
      "etc.). In some cases, two reports may be necessary to meet both the Company’s reporting \n",
      "requirements and to take advantage of the protective provisions of ASAP.\n",
      "4. All reports are submitted electronically, via the AAG Safety Reporting System, and each \n",

      "b) Management issues external to the Company should also be considered. In \n",
      "some cases, industry or government oversight organizations which issue, \n",
      "control, and/or monitor operating certificates have their own influence on the \n",
      "way an incident occurs.\n",
      "5) Mission\n",
      "a) The type of mission or the purpose of the operation is also considered \n",
      "important during the investigation process. This is because each risk is \n",
      "associated with different types of operation which do vary. For example, “Is \n",
      "the mission/procedure too ambitious that it could not be achieved?” Each \n",

      "applies:\n",
      "a. Employee submits a safety report which is filtered to the appropriate division for review.\n",
      "b. Analyst reviews the report and generates an event without assigning an Event Level.\n",
      "c. Analyst will immediately contact their SMS Liaison and the appropriate Safety director \n",
      "or manager to trigger an investigation. An investigation will occur by either the \n",
      "operating division or the Safety division.\n",
      "d. Close Call events from the previous week will be reviewed at P-WSR. Events that do \n",
      "not have a completed investigation will be assigned an initial Event Level given current \n",
      "known information.\n",
      "e. Close Call events will be briefed at WSR, SPL, OPL, DAG, and SRB, as applicable.\n",

      "A. Overview\n",
      "1. The Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) is a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \n",
      "sponsored program designed to collect safety related information from employees and use \n",
      "that information to develop corrective/preventive actions to enhance safety. ASAP utilizes \n",
      "non-punitive incentives to encourage safety event reporting that may otherwise go \n",
      "unreported. This allows corrective actions to be implemented to enhance safety within the \n",
      "operation.\n",
      "2. AAG currently hosts ASAP programs for Pilots, Flight Attendants, Dispatchers, \n",
      "Maintenance Management and Maintenance Technicians. Alaska Airlines Airport \n",
      "Operations employees with union representation (Customer Service, Ramp, Cargo, \n",
      "Operations, Stores Agents, Crew Scheduling, Reservations, Accounting, and Records \n",
      "Specialists) are covered by the Ground Safety Action Program (GSAP), which has the same \n",
      "requirements of the ASAP Program. Each program is governed by a Memorandum of \n",
      "Understanding (MOU) agreed to by the representatives of the FAA, the Company, and \n",
      "employee union (where applicable).\n",
      "3. The ASAP program relies on the understanding and cooperation between the parties \n",
      "involved to function successfully. The MOU is the controlling document for the program and \n",
      "houses the standard operating procedures (SOP) for the workgroups. FAA guidance for \n",
      "ASAP is contained in Advisory Circular 120-66 (as amended), the FAA ASAP website, and \n",
      "directly from AFS-280.\n",
      "4. All ASAP programs are administered by the AAG Safety Division, and specifically by ASAP \n",
      "Specialists and Managers, with the assistance of the SMS Managers (as applicable); this \n",
      "establishes the ASAP Team. The team reports directly to the General Manager SMS and \n",
      "ASAP, who has overall authority of the program.\n",

      "anything related to the safety of the operation. Employees may also submit ASAP reports to \n",
      "highlight observed safety concerns.\n",
      "2. Accepted ASAP reports guarantee that, in the event of an FAR violation, no FAA \n",
      "enforcement action will be taken. Accepted ASAP reports also cannot be used by the \n",
      "Company to initiate or support any company discipline. The vast majority of reports are \n",
      "accepted.\n",
      "3. An ASAP report does not substitute for a required irregularity report (MIR, PIR, GIR, FAIR, \n",
      "etc.). In some cases, two reports may be necessary to meet both the Company’s reporting \n",
      "requirements and to take advantage of the protective provisions of ASAP.\n",
      "4. All reports are submitted electronically, via the AAG Safety Reporting System, and each \n",

      "specific statement that the report is being closed, and the basis for closing.\n",
      "b. Concurrence\n",
      "1) Prior to closing an SHR the Safety Representative assigned will contact the \n",
      "submitter (if possible) with an update and the intent to close the report. If the \n",
      "submitter expresses reservations about closing the report prior to a final \n",
      "resolution, those concerns should be noted. If the filer provides additional \n",

      "1. A close call is defined as an unplanned event that did not result in an injury, illness, incident, \n",
      "damage, or accident - but had the potential to do so. Only a fortunate break in the chain of \n",
      "events prevented a negative outcome. Often the words “luck” or “exceptional skill” are said \n",

      "outcome could have resulted in:\n",
      "a. Employee injury (Event Level C-F)\n",

      "c. Property damage (Event Level C-F)\n",
      "d. Regulatory noncompliance (Event Level C-F)\n",
      "2. It is essential to review Close Call events as if the worst credible outcome had occurred. In \n",
      "these events, little to no safety margin remains and the only elements protecting against a \n",
      "negative outcome is “luck” or “exceptional skill”. The following general Close Call process \n",
      "applies:\n",
      "a. Employee submits a safety report which is filtered to the appropriate division for review.\n",
      "b. Analyst reviews the report and generates an event without assigning an Event Level.\n",
      "c. Analyst will immediately contact their SMS Liaison and the appropriate Safety director \n",
      "or manager to trigger an investigation. An investigation will occur by either the \n",
      "operating division or the Safety division.\n",
      "d. Close Call events from the previous week will be reviewed at P-WSR. Events that do \n",
      "not have a completed investigation will be assigned an initial Event Level given current \n",
      "known information.\n",
      "e. Close Call events will be briefed at WSR, SPL, OPL, DAG, and SRB, as applicable.\n",
      "f. After the investigation has concluded, the Event Level will be updated, as applicable.\n",
      "g. All Close Call events will be given a System Assessment at P-WSR, WSR, and/or SPL \n",
      "meetings once the investigation has concluded.\n",
      "h. If the investigation identifies a new hazard, ineffective risk control, or change to policy / \n",
      "procedures, a reactive SRA will be conducted. If the investigation discovers non-\n",
      "compliance and/or non-conformance, a corrective/preventive action will be issued.\n",

      "Uncompromising Commitment to Safety\n",
      "The safety and well-being of our employees and guests is the foundation of everything we do at Alaska Airlines and \n",
      "Horizon Air, and overrides all other considerations. It is th e basis upon which our success rests. Each employee at every \n",
      "level of the organization is committed, accountable, and has the authority to maintain the highest level of safety for \n",
      "every employee, every customer, every flight, every day.\n",
      "To ensure our core value of safety is never compromised, we are committed to the following:\n",
      "1) We recognize our fundamental obligation is to transpor t our guests and employees safely to their destinations, \n",
      "understanding they entrust their lives to us upon boarding our aircraft. We will always honor this trust, and will \n",
      "never jeopardize safety in the pursuit of other initiatives.\n",
      "2) Our primary safety objective is to identify, monitor, and mi tigate safety risks to as low as reasonably practical. To \n",
      "that end, we will never stop improving and advancing ou r Safety Management System (SMS), and will provide \n",
      "the necessary financial, personnel, and other resources needed to manage safety risk in order to continuously \n",
      "build upon our robust culture of safety.\n",
      "3) We will set and regularly review our safety goals and ob jectives and clearly communicate these to all employees\n",
      "and business partners. Additionally, thes e objectives will be continually moni tored, measured, and tracked, and \n",
      "all levels of management will be responsible to ensure these goals are relevant and achieved.\n",
      "4) We will ensure that all employees and business part ners understand the requirement to report any safety \n",
      "hazard, incident, or concern. Our comprehensive safety  reporting system includes irregularity reporting for all \n",
      "operating divisions, Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) reporting for all front-line workgroups, and the \n",
      "Safety Hazard Report (SHR) or Safety Hotline for reporting directly to the safety division.\n",
      "5) We will ensure that employees know they will never be disciplined for reporting a safety hazard or event.\n",
      "Unacceptable behaviors, illegal activities, or intentional di sregard for regulations, policies, or procedures, are \n",
      "however subject to discipline.\n",
      "6) We will continue to promote the principles of \"Ready, Safe, Go\" and ensure that employees and business \n",
      "partners know they are empowered to stop the operation any time something appears to be unsafe.\n",
      "7) Our response to any emergency will be measured, coor dinated and timely in acco rdance with our emergency \n",

      "1.Responsibility - Who is accountable for management and overall quality of the process \n",
      "(planning, organizing, directing, controlling (and its ultimate accomplishment).\n",
      "2.Authority  - Who can direct, control, or change the process, as well as who can make key \n",
      "decisions such as risk acceptance. This attribute also includes the concept of \n",
      "empowerment.\n",
      "3.Procedures  - International Organization for Standardization (ISO)-9001-2000 defines \n",
      "“procedures” as “a specified way to carry out an activity or a process” - procedures translate \n",
      "the “what” in goals and objectives into how in practical activities (things people do). \n",

      "perform a process. The organization should specify their own procedures for accomplishing \n",
      "processes in the context of their unique operational environment, organizational structure, \n",
      "and management objectives. \n",

      "procedures, or procedural steps, and supervisory practices designed to keep processes on \n",
      "track to achieve their intended results. Organizational process controls are typically defined \n",

      "Many controls are inherent features of the FAA SMS Framework. Practices such as \n",
      "continuous monitoring, internal audits, internal evaluations, and management reviews (all \n",
      "parts of the Safety Assurance (SA) component) are identified as controls within the design \n",
      "expectations. Additionally, other practices such as documentation, process reviews, and \n",

      "5.Process Measures  - Ways to provide feedback to responsible parties that required actions \n",
      "are taking place, required outputs are being produced, and expected outcomes are being \n",
      "achieved. A basic principle of SA is that fundamental processes be measured so that \n",

      "3. Closing Criteria\n",
      "a. Due to the possible variations in reports, it is not practical to establish specific criteria to \n",
      "close a report. However, the Safety Representative assigned to an SHR should ensure:\n",
      "1) The specific safety concerns of the report are understood.\n",
      "2) All findings identified in the review have been assessed and communicated for \n",
      "appropriate action.\n",
      "3) All Safety Representative actions relating to the SHR are logged into the Actions \n",
      "Taken section of the SHR. Documentation includes: action item(s), the process \n",
      "owner(s), and date the action was taken.\n",
      "4) When a report is being closed, the activity narrative shall be updated to include a \n",
      "specific statement that the report is being closed, and the basis for closing.\n",
      "b. Concurrence\n",
      "1) Prior to closing an SHR the Safety Representative assigned will contact the \n",
      "submitter (if possible) with an update and the intent to close the report. If the \n",
      "submitter expresses reservations about closing the report prior to a final \n",
      "resolution, those concerns should be noted. If the filer provides additional \n",
      "information that is pertinent to the report, it should not be closed until those \n",
      "concerns are addressed. If no new information is brought forward, the report \n",
      "should be closed.\n",
      "c. Closing Notification\n",
      "1) Once the report is closed, the Safety Representative should send the submitter an \n",
      "email summarizing the review. Findings, recommendations, and actions generated \n",
      "by the review should be identified. The email should address any findings the Rev. 18\n",

      "4. If the analyst is unsure about an Event Level, they may leave the Event Level unassigned \n",
      "and contact the applicable Safety Manager/Director for assistance or if applicable, flag it for \n",
      "WSR to be assessed cross-divisionally.\n",
      "5. If the report was submitted to the wrong division or needs further action from outside the \n",
      "division (e.g., Security, Environmental, Catering, Fueling, etc.), the report will be sent to the \n",
      "appropriate division for actioning and/or awareness.\n",
      "6. Investigation criteria is based on the division specific Event Response Matrix (ERM) as \n",

      "investigation check-box in the event and follow the notification guidelines documented in \n",
      "the division specific Event Response Matrix. After the investigation process has concluded, \n",
      "the Event Level may be updated to reflect new information, as applicable.\n",
      "7. Analysts should flag the following types of events for discussion at the applicable meeting:\n",
      "a. WSR:\n",
      "1) Event that warrants cross-divisional discussion, not just cross-divisional action\n",
      "2) Close call events\n",

      "E. Close Call Processing Procedures\n",
      "1. A close call is defined as an unplanned event that did not result in an injury, illness, incident, \n",
      "damage, or accident - but had the potential to do so. Only a fortunate break in the chain of \n",
      "events prevented a negative outcome. Often the words “luck” or “exceptional skill” are said \n",
      "to be the only barrier remaining. AAG defines a Close Call where the worst credible \n",
      "outcome could have resulted in:\n",
      "a. Employee injury (Event Level C-F)\n",
      "b. Aircraft damage (Event Level C-F)\n",
      "c. Property damage (Event Level C-F)\n",
      "d. Regulatory noncompliance (Event Level C-F)\n",
      "2. It is essential to review Close Call events as if the worst credible outcome had occurred. In \n",
      "these events, little to no safety margin remains and the only elements protecting against a \n",
      "negative outcome is “luck” or “exceptional skill”. The following general Close Call process \n",
      "applies:\n",
      "a. Employee submits a safety report which is filtered to the appropriate division for review.\n",
      "b. Analyst reviews the report and generates an event without assigning an Event Level.\n",
      "c. Analyst will immediately contact their SMS Liaison and the appropriate Safety director \n",
      "or manager to trigger an investigation. An investigation will occur by either the \n",
      "operating division or the Safety division.\n",
      "d. Close Call events from the previous week will be reviewed at P-WSR. Events that do \n",
      "not have a completed investigation will be assigned an initial Event Level given current \n",
      "known information.\n",
      "e. Close Call events will be briefed at WSR, SPL, OPL, DAG, and SRB, as applicable.\n",
      "f. After the investigation has concluded, the Event Level will be updated, as applicable.\n",
      "g. All Close Call events will be given a System Assessment at P-WSR, WSR, and/or SPL \n",
      "meetings once the investigation has concluded.\n",
      "h. If the investigation identifies a new hazard, ineffective risk control, or change to policy / \n",
      "procedures, a reactive SRA will be conducted. If the investigation discovers non-\n",
      "compliance and/or non-conformance, a corrective/preventive action will be issued.\n",
      "i. Close Call events will be reviewed and tracked at the respective DAG(s)/SRB(s) until \n",

      "9.7.5 Aviation Safety Action Programs (ASAP)\n",
      "A. Overview\n",
      "1. The Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) is a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \n",
      "sponsored program designed to collect safety related information from employees and use \n",
      "that information to develop corrective/preventive actions to enhance safety. ASAP utilizes \n",
      "non-punitive incentives to encourage safety event reporting that may otherwise go \n",
      "unreported. This allows corrective actions to be implemented to enhance safety within the \n",
      "operation.\n",
      "2. AAG currently hosts ASAP programs for Pilots, Flight Attendants, Dispatchers, \n",
      "Maintenance Management and Maintenance Technicians. Alaska Airlines Airport \n",
      "Operations employees with union representation (Customer Service, Ramp, Cargo, \n",
      "Operations, Stores Agents, Crew Scheduling, Reservations, Accounting, and Records \n",
      "Specialists) are covered by the Ground Safety Action Program (GSAP), which has the same \n",
      "requirements of the ASAP Program. Each program is governed by a Memorandum of \n",
      "Understanding (MOU) agreed to by the representatives of the FAA, the Company, and \n",
      "employee union (where applicable).\n",
      "3. The ASAP program relies on the understanding and cooperation between the parties \n",
      "involved to function successfully. The MOU is the controlling document for the program and \n",
      "houses the standard operating procedures (SOP) for the workgroups. FAA guidance for \n",
      "ASAP is contained in Advisory Circular 120-66 (as amended), the FAA ASAP website, and \n",
      "directly from AFS-280.\n",
      "4. All ASAP programs are administered by the AAG Safety Division, and specifically by ASAP \n",
      "Specialists and Managers, with the assistance of the SMS Managers (as applicable); this \n",
      "establishes the ASAP Team. The team reports directly to the General Manager SMS and \n",
      "ASAP, who has overall authority of the program.\n",
      "5. There are times when an ASAP report and a voluntary disclosure (VDRP) are submitted to \n",
      "the FAA specific to a singular event. Confidentiality will be maintained to ensure trust in the Rev. 18\n",

      "B. Submitting ASAP Reports\n",
      "1. ASAP is a voluntary program and reports are never required; however, reporting is highly \n",
      "recommended whenever an employee believes that they may have violated a Federal \n",
      "Aviation Regulation (FAR), Federal or State regulations, Company policy or procedure, or \n",
      "anything related to the safety of the operation. Employees may also submit ASAP reports to \n",
      "highlight observed safety concerns.\n",
      "2. Accepted ASAP reports guarantee that, in the event of an FAR violation, no FAA \n",
      "enforcement action will be taken. Accepted ASAP reports also cannot be used by the \n",
      "Company to initiate or support any company discipline. The vast majority of reports are \n",
      "accepted.\n",
      "3. An ASAP report does not substitute for a required irregularity report (MIR, PIR, GIR, FAIR, \n",
      "etc.). In some cases, two reports may be necessary to meet both the Company’s reporting \n",
      "requirements and to take advantage of the protective provisions of ASAP.\n",
      "4. All reports are submitted electronically, via the AAG Safety Reporting System, and each \n",

      "ASAP Facilitator can begin researching and gathering related details on the event (log \n",
      "pages, schedules, corresponding irregularity reports, company related investigation), and \n",
      "provide that information to the ERC members. The ASAP Facilitator also places the event \n",
      "on the agenda for the next ERC meeting.\n",
      "4. ERC members review the events, including related details gathered by the ASAP Facilitator \n",
      "prior to the meeting, and can comment on it using the review process in the AAG Safety \n",
      "Reporting System.\n",
