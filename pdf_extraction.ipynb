The following is a copy of the Company’s Safety Policy Statement:\\nFigure 1-1: Safety Policy StatementRev. March 6, 2023\\nAlaska Airlines’ and Horizon Air’s Safety Policy\\nUncompromising Commitment to Safety\\nThe safety and well-being of our employees and guests is the foundation of everything we do at Alaska Airlines and \\nHorizon Air, and overrides all other considerations. It is th e basis upon which our success rests. Each employee at every \\nlevel of the organization is committed, accountable, and has the authority to maintain the highest level of safety for \\nevery employee, every customer, every flight, every day.\\nTo ensure our core value of safety is never compromised, we are committed to the following:\\n1) We recognize our fundamental obligation is to transpor t our guests and employees safely to their destinations, \\nunderstanding they entrust their lives to us upon boarding our aircraft. We will always honor this trust, and will \\nnever jeopardize safety in the pursuit of other initiatives.\\n2) Our primary safety objective is to identify, monitor, and mi tigate safety risks to as low as reasonably practical. To \\nthat end, we will never stop improving and advancing ou r Safety Management System (SMS), and will provide \\nthe necessary financial, personnel, and other resources needed to manage safety risk in order to continuously \\nbuild upon our robust culture of safety.\\n3) We will set and regularly review our safety goals and ob jectives and clearly communicate these to all employees\\nand business partners.

This involves the processes of identifying a question or issue to be \\naddressed, modeling the issue, investigating model results, interpreting the results and possibly \\nmaking a recommendation. Analysis typically involves using scientific or mathematical methods \\nfor evaluation.\\nD.As Low as Reasonably Practicable (ALARP)  - A concept based on achieving balance \\nbetween the costs, difficulty, trouble, and time of risk reduction measures and the perceived \\nactual benefits. ALARP requires the identification of potential risk reduction measures and a \\ndetermination of whether it is ‘reasonably practicable’ to apply them.\\nE.Assessment - The process of measuring or judging the value or level of something.Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='4 of 10\\nChapter 5Safety Management System Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nF.Attributes  - System Attributes, the inherent characteristics of a system, are present in any well-\\ndefined organization and apply to an effective SMS. While the six system attributes were first \\napplied with ATOS fielding, there are differences when applied to SMS, as discussed below: \\n1.Responsibility - Who is accountable for management and overall quality of the process \\n(planning, organizing, directing, controlling (and its ultimate accomplishment).\\n2.Authority  - Who can direct, control, or change the process, as well as who can make key \\ndecisions such as risk acceptance. This attribute also includes the concept of \\nempowerment.\\n3.Procedures  - International Organization for Standardization (ISO)-9001-2000 defines \\n“procedures” as “a specified way to carry out an activity or a process” - procedures translate \\nthe “what” in goals and objectives into how in practical activities (things people do). \\nProcedures are simply documented activities to accomplish processes, e.g., a way to \\nperform a process. The organization should specify their own procedures for accomplishing \\nprocesses in the context of their unique operational environment, organizational structure, \\nand management objectives. \\n4.Controls  - Controls are elements of the system, including hardware, software, special \\nprocedures, or procedural steps, and supervisory practices designed to keep processes on \\ntrack to achieve their intended results. Organizational process controls are typically defined \\nin terms of special procedures, supervisory and management practices, and processes. \\nMany controls are inherent features of the FAA SMS Framework. Practices such as \\ncontinuous monitoring, internal audits, internal evaluations, and management reviews (all \\nparts of the Safety Assurance (SA) component) are identified as controls within the design \\nexpectations. Additionally, other practices such as documentation, process reviews, and \\ndata tracking are identified as controls within specific elements and processes.\\n5.Process Measures  - Ways to provide feedback to responsible parties that required actions \\nare taking place, required outputs are being produced, and expected outcomes are being \\nachieved. A basic principle of SA is that fundamental processes be measured so that \\nmanagement decisions can be data-driven. The general expectations for §5, Subpart B, \\nSafety Policy specify that SMS outputs be measured and analyzed. These measurements \\nand analyses are accomplished in 14 CFR Part 5, Subpart D, Safety Assurance. Outputs of \\neach process should, therefore, be identified during Safety Assurance activities. For \\nexample, these outputs should be the subjects of continuous monitoring, internal audits, \\nand internal evaluation. \\n6.Interfaces - This aspect includes examining such things as lines of authority between \\ndepartments, lines of communication between employees, consistency of procedures and \\nclearly delineating lines of responsibility between organizations, work units, and employees. \\nInterfaces are the inputs and outputs of a process. \\n7.Safety Ownership  - An individual’s understanding of how their role contributes to the \\noverall safety of the organization. Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"5 of 10\\nChapter 5Safety Management System Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nG.Audit  - Scheduled, formal reviews and verifications that evaluate whether an organization has \\ncomplied with policy, standards, and/or contract requirements. An audit starts with the \\nmanagement and operations of the organization and then moves to the organization's activities \\nand products/services.\\n1.Internal audit  - An audit conducted by, or on behalf of, the organization being audited, e.g., \\nthe flight training department audits the flight-training department (Ex: Divisional QA, \\nInternal Audit, IEP).\\n2.External audit  - An audit conducted by an entity outside of the organization being audited, \\ne.g., the flight operations division audits the flight training department. External audits are \\nalso performed by entities outside of the company (Ex: FAA, DOD, IOSA).\\nH.Complete  - Nothing has been omitted and what is stated is essential and appropriate to the \\nlevel of detail.\\nI.Competency  - An observable, measurable set [pattern] of skills, knowledge, abilities, behaviors, \\nand other characteristics that an individual needs to perform work roles of occupational functions \\nsuccessfully. Competencies are typically required at different levels of proficiency depending on \\nthe work roles. Competencies can help ensure that individual and team performances align with \\nthe organization's mission and strategic direction.\\nJ.Conformity  - Fulfilling or complying with a requirement [refer to ISO 9001-2000]; this includes \\nbut is not limited to complying with Federal regulations. It also includes complying with company \\nrequirements, requirements of operator developed risk controls, or operator policies and \\nprocedures.\\nK.Continuous Monitoring  - Uninterrupted (constant) watchfulness (checks, audits, etc.) over a \\nsystem. Continuous Monitoring is part of the Safety Assurance process.\\nL.Controls  - Controls are elements of the system, including hardware, software, special \\nprocedures or procedural steps, and supervisory practices designed to keep processes on track \\nto achieve their intended results. Organizational process controls are typically defined in terms \\nof special procedures, supervisory and management practices, and processes. Many controls \\nare inherent features of the SMS Framework. Practices such as continuous monitoring, internal \\naudits, internal evaluations, and management reviews (all parts of the safety assurance \\ncomponent) are identified as controls within the design expectations. Additionally, other \\npractices such as documentation, process reviews, and data tracking are identified as controls \\nwithin specific elements and processes.\\nM.Corrective Action  - Action to eliminate (remove) or mitigate (lessen) the cause or reduce the \\neffects of a detected nonconformity or other undesirable (unwanted) situation (reactive). \\nN.Correct  - Accurate without ambiguity or error in its attributes.\\nO.Credible Outcomes  - The most severe consequences, considering all scenarios and their \\noutcomes, that are considered plausible or reasonably believable. Not the worst case scenario.\\nP.Department - Refer to Sub-system.\\nQ.Division  - Refer to System.Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023\", metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 30}),\n",

In this context, documentation is different from records because documentation \\nis the written description of policies, processes, procedures, objectives, requirements, \\nauthorities, responsibilities, or work instructions; whereas Records are the evidence of results \\nachieved or activities performed. Evaluation - An independent review of company policies, \\nprocedures, and systems [ref. AC 120-59A]. If accomplished by the company itself, the \\nevaluation should be done by a person or organization in the company other than the one \\nperforming the function being evaluated. The evaluation process builds on the concepts of \\nauditing and inspection. An evaluation is an anticipatory process designed to identify and correct \\npotential problems before they happen. An evaluation is synonymous with the term “systems \\naudit.”\\nS.Event Level  - The severity of the actual outcome of a negative event.\\nT.Function  - A function consists of specific or discreet actions required by a system to achieve an \\nobjective (e.g., an operation that a system must perform in order to accomplish its mission, such \\nas a maintenance action required to restore a system to operation). Such actions may be \\naccomplished using equipment, personnel, facilities, firmware, software, or a combination \\nthereof. In a broader sense, the term function refers to what is expected to be incorporated into \\neach system rather than how the system accomplishes its objective. This maximizes scalability \\nwhile preserving standardization of results across the aviation organization communities.\\nU.Hazard  - A condition, object, deficiency, or activity that could have, or already has, contributed to \\nan unplanned/undesired event, such as a non-compliance, injury, incident, or accident.\\nV.Incident  - A negative occurrence other than an accident which affects or could affect the safety \\nof operations.\\nW.Ineffective Risk Controls  - Risk controls that may have been effective at one time, but due to \\nchanging environment, equipment, employee demographics, etc., the original control is no \\nlonger effective. \\nX.Input - What is put in, taken in, or operated on by any process or system.\\nY.Lagging Indicator  - Reflects a historical performance.\\nZ.Leading Indicator  - Conditions, events, or data that may precede an undesirable outcome.\\nAA.Learning Management System  - The approved AAG Learning Management System consists \\nof the OpSpec systems, which include Greenlight and Cornerstone for Alaska Airlines' and \\nHorizon Air’s training records and Pelesys for legacy Virgin America training records.\\nAB.Lessons Learned  - Knowledge or understanding gained by experience, which may be positive, \\nsuch as a successful test or mission, or negative, such as a mishap or failure. Lessons learned \\nshould be developed from information obtained from inside and outside of the organization and/\\nor industry. \\nAC.Likelihood  - The estimated probability or frequency, in quantitative or qualitative terms, of an \\noccurrence related to the hazard (probability of a specific outcome occurring). Combined with \\nseverity, equals risk.Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023\", metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",

Mitigation plans should be applied in order to achieve risk that is as low as reasonably \\npracticable (ALARP). See also Risk Control.\\nAF.Nonconformity  - Non-fulfillment of a requirement (ref. ISO 9001-2000). This could include, but \\nis not limited to, noncompliance with Federal regulations, company requirements, requirements \\nof operator-developed risk controls or operator-specified policies and procedures. \\nAG.Objective  - The desired state or performance target of a process. Usually it is the final state of a \\nprocess and contains the results and outputs used to obtain the desired state or performance \\ntarget. \\nAH.Operational Life Cycle  - Period from implementation of a product/service until it is no longer in \\nuse. \\nAI.Organization  - Within the context of this document, the term organization refers to any \\norganization providing aviation services. The term includes certificated and non-certificated \\naviation organizations, aviation service providers, air carriers, airlines, maintenance repair \\norganization, air taxi operations, corporate flight departments, repair stations, pilot schools, \\napproved training organizations that are exposed to safety risks during the provision of their \\nservices and organizations responsible for type design and/or manufacture of aircraft.

This process is used to understand critical characteristics of systems and their sub-systems \\nincluding activities, resources and operational environments and to use this knowledge to \\nidentify hazards, analyze and assess risk, and design risk controls. Divisional and corporate \\nmanagement reviews such as daily operational meetings, DAGs, SRBs and ESRBs, provide a \\nvenue to channel identified risks along with change management procedures. The Risk Register \\n(or process defined in Section 8.6 ) will be used to document and track safety risks identified \\nduring changes or modifications to the operational processes within the organization. The Risk \\nRegister is available under the Reference/Tools menu of the AAG Safety Website (§5.97(a)).\\nB. The SRM process can be used in 3 ways: reactive, proactive and predictive.\\n1. The reactive use of SRM is in response to a hazard or ineffective risk control found through \\nthe Safety Assurance (SA) process, often an investigation (described in Chapter 9  - refer to \\nFigure 8-1  and Figure A-4 ), or that has led to a negative outcome or consequence within the \\noperation (Ex: aircraft damage or injury). (§5.51(d)).\\n2. The proactive use of SRM includes SA inputs to identify changes in the operation that could \\nlead to new hazards and to identify controls that are no longer effective for correction prior \\nto a negative outcome, and to analyze proposed changes to identify potential hazards for \\ncorrection prior to implementation (§5.51(a)-(c)).\\n3. The predictive use of SRM includes SA inputs and current data to provide insight into future \\nhazards and outcomes that might occur using data modeling.\\n8.2 SRM Processes\\nA. SRM process steps are included below, and are further defined within this manual section.\\n1. System Description and Task Analysis (used for proposed changes)\\n2. Hazard Identification\\n3. Safety Risk Analysis\\n4. Safety Risk Assessment\\n5. Safety Risk Control or Mitigation\\n8.3 SRM Triggers\\nA. The SRM process is initiated by the following “triggers” (§5.51 and §5.73(a)(4)-(5) & (b)):\\n1. New or revised process or procedures\\n2. New or revised operation or environment\\n3. New or revised system, organization or resourcesRev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 49}),\n",

System Description/Task Analysis and Hazard Identification will be performed for the triggering \\nevents listed in Section 8.3 . Perform these steps to ensure an understanding of the current \\nscope of the system being changed, the impact of the change on the function, resources, and \\nenvironment, and the hazards that could be introduced as a result. These are the first two \\nprocess steps in the SRM row of Figure 8-1 , following the proposed change. Refer to Section \\n8.3 for criteria that will help determine whether the system, its function, environment or \\nresources are being changed. If new controls are developed, they are evaluated to determine \\ntheir impact, considering the existing system and tasks, to evaluate the impact and to determine \\nwhether the risk will be reduced. The Risk Register will be used to document considerations and \\nthe output of the SRM process per this section and Section 7.8 , with the only exception being \\nSRM which is embedded into management of change procedures in accordance with Section \\n8.6 (§5.53).\\n8.4.1 System Description and Task Analysis (§5.53(a) and (b))\\nA. The purpose of the System Description and Task Analysis is to understand the current state of \\nthe system or process within the scope of the change, new hazard or ineffective risk control well \\nenough to identify any potential hazards that could result. This is the first step in Figure 8-1 . The \\nSystem Description identifies the system and its function within the scope of the change, new \\nhazard or ineffective risk control. The Task Analysis is the consideration and description of the \\nactions performed, the resources needed to perform them, their environment, their interfaces \\nwithin and across the system, and the resulting impact of any proposed changes (§5.53(b)).\\nB. The System Description and Task Analysis will be detailed enough to (5.53(c)):\\n1. Identify hazards\\n2. Develop operational procedures\\n3. Develop and implement risk controls\\nC. Since the System Description and Task Analysis is the first step of SRM, it is important to identify \\nwhat a system is. Systems are comprised of people, equipment, training/information, \\nprocedures, facilities and services. The terms “System” and “Division” will be used \\ninterchangeably in this manual. Operational “Systems” at Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air are:\\n1. Airport Operations and Customer Service or Stations, and Cargo\\n2. Flight Operations\\n3. Inflight\\n4. Maintenance and Engineering\\n5. SafetyRev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 51}),\n",

The systems listed in Section 8.4  include several sub-systems. “Sub-systems” may also be \\nreferred to as “Departments”, or may also be functions or a set of procedures without being a \\nformal department. Some examples of sub-systems are Dispatch, Crew Scheduling, Training, \\nMaintenance Control, CLP, Fueling, GSE, Deicing and Dangerous Goods. Representatives from \\nall potentially impacted systems and sub-systems are included in the SRM process.\\nE. The System Description and Task Analysis answers the following three questions §5.53(a)):\\n1. Step 1: What is the current system/sub-system (division/department), tasks (process/\\nprocedures, environment, resources needed) and their interface with each other?\\n2. Step 2: What is being changed or introduced?\\n3. Step 3: What is the impact? (leads to hazard identification)\\nF. Step 1 - Considers and describes the current state (within the scope of the proposed change, \\nnew hazard or ineffective risk control). These considerations are important to ensure a clear \\nunderstanding of the current state in order to understand how it will interface with the proposed \\nchange in place.\\n1. System/Sub-System - What divisions/departments are involved? \\n2. People - Who is performing the tasks and how do they interface with other employees?\\na. Consider: culture, human factors, workload, distraction, fatigue, complexity, operational \\npressures, communication/language/terminology and physical limitations\\n3. Process/Procedure - What are the related tasks being performed by people within the \\naffected areas? \\na. Consider: training, manuals, job instructions, task cards, checklists, procedures, \\ndeviation from procedures, complexity\\n4. Environment and Facilities - What is the operating environment?\\na. Consider: physical environment, lighting, elements, temperature, noise levels, \\nbuildings, structures and their limitations\\n5. Equipment - What resources are used to perform the task?\\na. Consider: equipment, tools, hardware, software, GSE, maintenance, associated \\nlimitations/design factors, warning systems and resilience of equipment to errors\\n6. Oversight/Management -\\na. Consider: supervision, how easily are errors identified, inspections and effectiveness of \\ncurrent controls\\nG. Step 2 – Considers and describes what is being changed or introduced using knowledge of the \\ncurrent state from Step 1.\\nH. Step 3 –This step evaluates how the change, new hazard, or ineffective risk control will interface \\nwith the existing system(s), sub-system(s) and their activities, resources and environment, and \\nshould include procedures and controls that will be included in the change.

The Risk Register must be used to document the output of the SRM process.\\nB. The level of detail used to consider and describe the System Description and Task Analysis will \\nvary based on scope and complexity.\\n1. For small changes, a simple description of the applicable considerations may be adequate. \\nThis step may be completed quickly by an individual or a small group of SMEs.\\n2. For large changes, a description could also be used. Tools such as data on the current \\nprocess, observations, brainstorming, a fishbone diagram (6Ms), detailed current and future \\nstate process maps or benchmarking may be helpful. A large cross-divisional team may \\nneed to be assembled to assess multiple facets of the proposed change.\\nC. A division can request SRM facilitation support from the Managing Director, Safety Programs or \\nthe General Manager, SMS & ASAP. For SRM that involves more than two operating divisions, \\nor is complex, support from the Safety Division is recommended.\\n8.4.3 Identify Hazards (§5.53(c))\\nA. Hazard Identification is the output of the System Description and Task Analysis (for proposed \\nchanges) or the output of the System Assessment within the Safety Assurance (SA) process \\n(where a new hazard or ineffective risk control is identified). This step is indicated by the first \\ndiamond in Figure 8-1  within both the SA and SRM processes, and determines whether a \\nhazard is being introduced. The goal of the System Assessment or System Description/Task \\nAnalysis steps is to identify hazards for the entire scope of the system, especially ones that \\ncould cause death, serious physical harm, or damage to equipment or property, and to describe \\nthem in enough detail to determine risk level, risk acceptance and to develop risk control \\n(§5.55). Identified hazards will be documented and tracked through the remaining SRM steps \\n(§5.53(c) and §5.97(a)).\\nB. Definition: A hazard is a condition, object, deficiency, or activity that could have, or already has, \\ncontributed to an unplanned/undesired event, such as a non-compliance, injury, incident, or \\naccident.\\n1. Considering the impact of the change from the System Description/Task Analysis in Steps 1 \\n– 3, or the hazard identified from the System Assessment in Section 9.9 , consider the \\nfollowing:\\na. “What if…?” (consider typical and abnormal conditions)\\nb. “What could go wrong?” (could it cause or contribute to an accident or incident)\\n1) An individual or team should use experience, regulatory requirements, \\nmanufacturers’ technical data and knowledge of the operation to identify hazards.\\n2. When determining if a hazard is present, consider the answers to the previous questions \\nand determine whether it could cause or contribute to the following:\\na. Harm to people (employees or passengers)\\nb. Harm to equipment (including aircraft, GSE, tools, facilities, etc.)Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",

Regulatory non-compliance, company non-conformance or loss\\n3. Document whether a hazard(s) has been identified from the SRM or SA process using the \\nRisk Register (§5.53(c) and §5.97(a)).\\n4. For existing hazards identified from the System Assessment process (described in Section \\n9.9) or potential new hazards identified from the System Description and Task Analysis \\nprocess (described in Section 8.4 ), proceed to Section 8.5  for risk assessment and \\nanalysis. If, through the System Description and Task Analysis and Hazard Identification \\nprocess (described in Section 8.4 ), no new potential hazards are present, a risk \\nassessment is not needed. Following implementation, the new process and controls are \\nmonitored through the ongoing continuous monitoring process described in Chapter 9 . If, \\nfollowing implementation, a new hazard or ineffective risk control is identified, the SRM \\nprocess will be used to redesign controls, and lessons learned will be collected to better \\nidentify potential hazards.\\n8.5 Risk Analysis, Assessment and Control (§5.55)\\nA. The purpose of these steps is to estimate the severity and likelihood of an outcome (incident or \\naccident) associated with each identified hazard, acceptability of the risk level and the need for \\nrisk control. While performing these steps, it is important to have a clear understanding of the \\nhazard, associated outcome and the system since these will affect the risk level and the action \\ntaken in response. Risk acceptance ensures that individuals who are in a position to allocate \\nresources are also part of the risk acceptance process.\\n8.5.1 Analyze and Assess Safety Risk (§5.55(a)-(b))\\nA. The analysis will consider the credible outcome associated with the hazard to determine “how \\nlikely?” it is to occur and “how bad?” it would be. The assessment will quantify the outcome in \\nterms of severity and likelihood and determine acceptability.\\n1. Individuals who are authorized to perform safety risk analysis, assessment and acceptance \\ndecisions are defined in the training requirements listed in Section 10.2\\nB. Safety Risk Analysis determines the severity and likelihood of the potential outcome (incident or \\naccident) associated with each hazard. This step considers the condition that is being created, \\nintroduced or is present from the System Description/Task Analysis or from the System \\nAssessment, and what could reasonably result. Considerations include existing risk controls and \\ntheir effectiveness, triggering mechanisms that could affect the hazardous condition and result in \\na negative outcome, as well as a credible outcome that could result. The severity and likelihood \\nassociated with the credible outcome are evaluated (§5.55(a)).\\n1. For each hazard, consider and document the potential outcome (Ex: what type of injury, \\ndamage, accident or loss.). For hazards identified through the SA process, the outcome \\nmay have already occurred, or controls may not be as effective as needed to prevent \\nanother credible outcome.Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 54}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='7 of 21\\nChapter 8Safety Management System Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nNOTE\\nExisting safety risk controls will be considered when determining the outcome since their \\neffectiveness or ineffectiveness can help identify a credible outcome. For potential hazards \\nidentified through the management of change/proactive SRM process, the outcome should \\ntake existing and planned controls and procedures into consideration.\\n2. The outcome should be credible. If multiple outcomes are possible, the worst credible \\noutcome (not worst case scenario) should be used. For example, while there is a rare \\npotential for bird strikes to result in critical or catastrophic incidents, that is a worst-case \\nscenario, not a credible outcome. The worst credible outcome is often aircraft damage. \\nConsiderations to determine this would include types and number of birds at the location. It \\nis important to identify the credible outcome that could reasonably occur to ensure that we \\nare adequately protected against it. Do not assume a worst case scenario since that would \\nmean that all controls have failed. In most cases, this would not result in a credible \\noutcome. It is equally important to not assume that what has always happened will continue \\nto happen, especially if a change is being introduced.\\n3. Consider rate of exposure to the hazard. Analysis can be qualitative and/or quantitative, \\nbased on a combination of experience, judgment, and data from within the company and \\nthe industry (when needed). It is important to not only look at the past, but also to look at \\nwhat we anticipate in the future based on operational performance. Consider whether we \\nhave avoided outcomes because we are good (strong procedures/controls) or lucky. \\nQuestions that can help determine exposure to the hazard are:\\na. Is there a history of this type of event or is this an isolated occurrence?\\nb. Have we seen equipment or components of the same type with similar defects?\\nc. How many people follow or are affected by the procedures in question?\\nd. What percentage of the time is the equipment or the questionable procedure in use?\\ne. How effective are the remaining safety risk controls that are in use?\\n4. Safety Risk Assessment uses the Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Matrix to select \\nseverity and likelihood that describe the outcome of the hazard and to determine whether \\nthe risk is acceptable (§5.55(a)-(b)).\\na. Risk assessment is a core component of SMS and is used to assist management in \\nmaking decisions that impact safety. The purpose of conducting a formal safety risk \\nassessment is to prioritize items competing for limited resources and to identify \\nhazards requiring special handling. The Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Matrix \\n(pictured in Figure 8-3 ) is used to assess the risk associated with a hazard, and will be \\nused at Alaska and Horizon to ensure risk level standardization across the \\norganization.Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 55}),\n",

Management personnel are granted authority to accept risk applicable to their \\ndivision or area of risk. Management personnel must be considered a subject matter expert \\nin the area of risk and is trained in Safety Risk Management per the SMS Training Matrix \\n10-1. If risk is shared by both airlines (Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air) then risk must be \\naccepted by the appropriate level of management from each airline.

Qualifications: Individuals who make risk acceptance decisions must meet training \\nrequirements listed in this manual. Minimum levels of management personnel that can \\naccept risk are indicated in the “Actions Required” section of the Alaska Airlines and \\nHorizon Air SMS Matrix. Risk Acceptance levels are identified in the “Risk Acceptance & \\nMitigation Responsibility” column (refer to Figure 8-3 ).\\n4. Timeline:\\na. For SRM initiated from the SA process, Risk Acceptance must be performed as soon \\nas the initial (current state) risk is identified. The same Risk Acceptance authority will \\nbe involved in acceptance of the mitigation/risk control plan prior to implementation. By \\nentering the name of the individual accepting the risk into the Risk Register, you are \\nindicating that person has been presented with the hazard and risk information, and is \\naware of their role in the SRM.\\nb. For SRM initiated due to a change, the Risk Acceptance authority should be notified of \\nany hazards and initial risk(s) in a timely manner to accommodate related impact on \\nimplementation. Acceptance of the initial and/or revised risk and mitigation/risk control \\nplan will be performed once the SRM is complete, prior to implementation.\\n5. Risk Notification - It is the responsibility of the SRM facilitator to perform or delegate Risk \\nnotification for inputs that originate from the SA process. Refer to Figure 8-3  to review the \\nrisk notification levels based on risk level.) The notification role may be delegated to the \\nindividual who accepted the risk, or others within the notification chain, as long as the \\nnotification responsibility has been clearly communicated, the individuals are trained, and \\nthe responsibility has been accepted by those involved. Notification is inclusive from bottom \\nto the top of each risk level. For example, a risk level 4 notification would include those in \\nrisk level 1-3 notification.\\na. Timeline: Notification of a risk level three or higher identified through the Safety \\nAssurance process must be immediate and must include the safety director in the area \\nof risk and the General Manager, SMS & ASAP along with others who are impacted \\n(ex: Environmental, Corporate Communications). Notification is coordinated within \\neach division for risks that originated from proposed changes.\\n6.

Once hazards and their risks are fully understood, risk controls/mitigation plans are developed \\nfor each risk that is unacceptable (levels 3 and higher). Mitigation strategies shall be developed \\nno later than 30 days after designated as risk level 3 or higher. For lower risks, the goal is to \\nreduce risk to “As Low As Reasonably Practicable” (ALARP). Areas of consideration for the \\nmitigation plan are risk controls and procedural changes. The Hierarchy of Controls is listed \\nbelow for guidance, and is listed in order of effectiveness. Changes to complex or unclear \\nprocedures may be needed when the opportunity to simplify or standardize a process is \\nidentified.\\nB. The mitigation plan/risk controls will include elements below from the Hierarchy of Controls, \\nwhich are listed in order from most to least effective at reducing severity/likelihood. While the \\nfirst three on the list are the most effective since they have a significant impact on severity, \\nlikelihood, or both, it may be necessary to keep a balance between the initial risk and the \\nmitigation plan since the most effective controls may also be cost-prohibitive for lower risks. This \\nis the balance of production (goal to maintain the health of the organization) and protection (the \\nresources and effort to eliminate risk). When practical, eliminating the hazard is always the first \\nchoice.\\n1. Elimination - Eliminate the hazard. Design the hazard out by modifying the system (this \\ncould include hardware/software system changes, equipment or tool changes).\\n2. Substitution – Replaces a more hazardous option with a less hazardous one (an example \\nmight be to replace a harmful chemical with a less harmful one).\\n3. Engineering Controls – Physical barriers that protect people by reducing exposure or \\nseverity of the consequences (Ex: Mistake proofing).\\n4. Administrative controls – Procedural changes or training. Changes to the way people work \\nthat limit exposure to hazards. (Ex: training, signs, labels, staffing changes, supervision, \\nawareness, warnings or signals, advisories.)\\n5. Personal protective equipment (PPE) – Equipment that protects employees from potential \\nhazards that cannot be eliminated (Ex: vests, steel-toed shoes, safety glasses, gloves, hard \\nhats).\\n8.6.1 Revised Risk (Predicted Residual Risk and Substitute Risk)\\nA. Prior to implementation of new Risk Controls or the mitigation plan, the revised risk will be \\nassessed to determine if the risk will be reduced to an acceptable level if added to the current \\nenvironment. The risk control and mitigation plan will be ready to use in its intended environment \\nwhen evaluating what the revised risk will be following implementation. The revised risk \\nconsiders the impact of the mitigation plan/controls to address the initial risk (Predicted Residual \\nRisk) and whether any new risks (Substitute Risks) will be introduced unintentionally. The \\ncomponents that determine the revised risk, are the current operation, Predicted Revised Risk \\nand Substitute Risk (§5.55(d)).Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 64}),\n",

For changes with significant safety impact or an expensive change with an unverified benefit, an \\nisolated test of the change in a controlled environment may be needed to understand the revised \\nrisk and benefit.\\nC. Consider the system/sub-system, activities, resources and environment with the proposed \\nmitigation/controls in place. (§5.55(d)).\\n1. Document the mitigation plan within the Hazard Identification section of the Risk Register. \\nInclude a description of the plan, the name(s) of the individual(s) responsible for each \\naction, and when each action will be completed.\\n2. Consider the impact of the mitigation plan/controls.\\n3. Document any Substitute or Predicted Residual Risks that will remain or be introduced \\nwithin the Hazard Identification section of the Risk Register.\\n4. Assess the overall risk level that will be in place with the proposed mitigation/controls, \\nconsidering the previous three steps.\\n5. Document the revised risk level within the Hazard Identification section of the SRM Web \\nForm.\\nD. If the risk will be reduced to an acceptable level (per the matrix) or improved (ALARP), move to \\nthe risk acceptance and monitoring plan (§5.73(a)(3)). If the risk will not be reduced, it will be \\nnecessary to redesign the controls or the process to find a more effective solution.\\nE. Risk Acceptance – Approval of Risk Control and Mitigation Plan\\n1. Once developed, document the approved mitigation, actions and their owners, expected \\ncompletion dates (ECD), substitute and predicted residual risks, corresponding revised risk \\nlevel, review with the individual accepting the risk, and name of the individual who has \\naccepted the risk within the Hazard Identification of the Risk Register. By entering the name \\nof the individual accepting the risk into the Risk Register, you are indicating that person has \\nbeen presented with the information listed in this section, and is aware of their role in the \\nSRM.

The change is placed into the operation when the predicted revised risk level is acceptable, \\nconsidering the mitigation plan with controls in the intended environment. The SA processes are \\nused to monitor the risk controls to ensure they continue to be implemented as designed and \\ncontinue to be effective. A monitoring plan is required for all risks level 3 and higher for a \\nminimum of 90 days, or longer as needed (§5.73(a)(3)).\\nB. Develop a monitoring plan and a validation period to validate that the risk has been adequately \\nmitigated. Use the Monitoring section of the Risk Register and share this information with the \\nDAG. This will ensure that the mitigation plan meets the predicted residual and substitute risk \\nassessment and will ensure adequate monitoring of performance through the validation period. \\nThe actual Revised Risk will be validated against the improvement goal prior to closure. \\nDocument the following for the monitoring and validation plan:\\n1. What will be monitored?\\n2. How often will results be reviewed?\\n3. Who is responsible for the analysis and review?\\n4. What are the specific goals used to measure conformance?\\n8.6.3 Promotion and Lessons Learned\\nA. Safety Promotion and Improvement - Consider any safety promotion opportunities and ways to \\nshare lessons that have been identified as a result of the SRM. Examples may be details \\nidentified through investigation of the event that identified the new hazard or ineffective risk \\ncontrol. The lessons learned can provide valuable insight across the organization that will help \\nexplain the ‘why’ to affected employees, show the company’s dedication to safety and \\ncommitment to improvement and provide an example of the SMS at work.\\nB. SRM Improvement - The lessons learned section of the Risk Register can also be used to \\ndocument opportunities and best practices specific to the SRM process.\\n8.6.4 Approval\\nA. Present the following to the individual with the authority to accept the initial risk level within the \\norganization (and the safety director that supports the division if from SA and 3 or higher) prior to \\nimplementation:\\n1.

Implement the change and execute the monitoring and validation plan. After completion of the \\nSRM process, newly developed procedures and controls are monitored through the Safety \\nAssurance process described in Chapter 9  of this manual (§5.73(a)(3)).\\n1. Monitoring: Review conformance of the control(s) and mitigation plan goals that were \\nidentified to measure the revised risk against the actual performance at identified intervals \\nper the monitoring plan. Items requiring mitigation will be monitored during a validation \\nperiod prior to closure. The hazard will be monitored through the validation process, and \\nongoing through the safety assurance process. Open items are reviewed during the \\ncorporate and divisional SRB processes through mitigation and reviewed prior to validation \\nand closure. If the mitigation plan or controls are not effective at maintaining the goals \\nestablished for the monitoring plan and revised risk, the original SRM will be re-visited and \\nrevised to meet performance expectations.\\n2. Validation – Determine whether the risk controls are successful at achieving the goal \\nestablished in the monitoring and validation plan. If not performing as expected, a decision \\nwill be made by the DAG to monitor, take corrective/preventative action or re-enter SRM. If \\nsuccessful after the minimum 90 day monitoring period, the topic will be proposed for \\nclosure by the DAG at the SRB. All open Risk Levels 3 and higher from SA will be reviewed \\nat each DAG, SRB and ESRB from identification through closure.\\n3. Closure - Close the topic if further action is not required, and include the topic in the \\ncontinuous monitoring process for ongoing review (refer to Section 9.1 ).

As part of this commitment, and/or the AAG Safety Reporting System are \\navailable to all Company and business partner employees for the reporting of safety related \\nconcerns. All safety reports will be investigated to the degree necessary to ensure any \\nidentified hazards are either accepted, eliminated, or mitigated to an acceptable risk level.\\n2. The success of our safety program depends on the support of all employees. A large part of \\nthat support relies on Company and business partner employees knowing that any \\nsubmitted reports will be reviewed and acted upon appropriately. \\nB. Responsibility and Authority\\n1. Responsibility for the AAG Safety Reporting System resides with the VP, Safety and \\nSecurity.\\n2. Authority for the program management is assigned to the MD, Safety Programs.\\n3. Authority for the day-to-day management is assigned to the divisional SMS Liaisons.\\nC. Training Requirements\\n1. Individuals designated as safety report analysts (Safety Hazard Reports, Irregularity \\nReports, ASAP Reports, and Employee Injury Reports) will receive training in accordance \\nwith Chapter 10.2 of this manual.\\n9.7.1 AAG SMS Matrix for Safety Reporting\\nA. During event analysis, the analyst will use the AAG SMS Matrix to assign an Event Level by \\nselecting a severity based on the actual outcome of an incident. The criteria used to describe the \\nEvent Level are outlined below:\\n1. Event Outcomes: These describe the type of incident. Analysts select the relevant criteria \\nfrom the event outcome types that apply.\\na. Injury or Illness - Used for employees or passengers if the injury or illness was caused \\nor contributed to by the Company.\\nb. Aircraft, Facility, Terrorism, or Security Event - Facility and security threats or NTSB \\nevents. Refer to the AAG Safety Manual, NTSB Reporting Requirements section for \\nmore information.\\nc.

A confidential Safety Hazard Report (SHR) can be sent directly to the Safety division for all \\nsafety related issues that cannot or are not being resolved at the division level.\\n2. SHRs are not a required submission. The Safety division would like a report submitted for \\nany hazard event that could have systemic implications of a possible hazard in another area \\nof the company, even if the event was resolved locally. As part of the submission, just note \\nthat the hazard was resolved and that the report is for information purposes only.\\n3. SHRs can be submitted through the AAG Safety Reporting System, the Safety Hotline, or \\nby speaking directly with a member of the Safety division.\\n4. The SHR will contain both the initial employee report and any additional actions taken to \\naddress the issues raised in the SHR.Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 75}),\n",

All SHRs using non-SHR form methods (i.e., safety hotline, etc.) of submission will be \\ntranscribed to an SHR immediately upon receipt by the Safety division. Reports that are \\nreceived vie telephone will be transcribed to the SHR form by Airport Operations Safety. \\nThe only method to report anonymously is via the safety hotline. All other methods are \\nconsidered confidential. Transcribing the report to this format allows for a written report to \\nbe generated and all associated activities logged.\\n6. All submitted SHRs are required to be brought to a reasonable solution.\\n7. Open SHRs will be reviewed weekly during Safety Performance Leadership (SPL)\\nB. Responsibilities\\n1. Safety will monitor all submitted SHRs daily. Each Safety Director/Manager is responsible \\nfor ensuring that all SHRs that have been submitted by their respective division members, \\nbut not yet closed, are still being actively researched and are moving towards resolution. \\nC. Timeline\\n1. The appropriate Ops Safety Manager will contact the SHR submitter within 24 hours (during \\nnormal business hours) or as otherwise requested, advising that the report has been \\nreceived and of any follow-up action.\\nD. Processing Procedures\\n1. Upon receipt of a new SHR, an Ops Safety Manager will:\\na. Review the report content and assign the report to an appropriate SME.\\nb. Update the event detailing any initial actions (including submitter contact).\\nc. Send an email via the AAG Safety Reporting System to inform the Safety \\nRepresentative that they have been assigned an SHR.\\nd. Send an email to the submitter, copying in the Safety Representative assigned the \\nevent, notifying them that Safety has received the SHR and the name of the Safety \\nRepresentative assigned. \\ne. Determine what aspects of the report are safety concerns and review to the extent \\nnecessary to ensure a full understanding of the reported concerns. The assigned \\nSafety Representative will analyze the SHR and provide the Initial Event Level.\\nf. Work to identify any immediate hazards and any related systemic issues that may \\nexist. The review may vary from manual research to more in-depth examinations \\ndepending on the complexity of the issue or event. Any findings of the review will be \\nanalyzed for risk and communicated to the process owner helping identify potential \\nSRA triggers. Recommendations should be developed by the process owner to \\neliminate or mitigate the hazard to an acceptable risk level.\\n2. Following initial receipt of the SHR, a Safety Representative for the same division as the \\nsubmitter will be assigned the SHR.\\na.

Due to the possible variations in reports, it is not practical to establish specific criteria to \\nclose a report. However, the Safety Representative assigned to an SHR should ensure:\\n1) The specific safety concerns of the report are understood.\\n2) All findings identified in the review have been assessed and communicated for \\nappropriate action.\\n3) All Safety Representative actions relating to the SHR are logged into the Actions \\nTaken section of the SHR. Documentation includes: action item(s), the process \\nowner(s), and date the action was taken.\\n4) When a report is being closed, the activity narrative shall be updated to include a \\nspecific statement that the report is being closed, and the basis for closing.\\nb. Concurrence\\n1) Prior to closing an SHR the Safety Representative assigned will contact the \\nsubmitter (if possible) with an update and the intent to close the report. If the \\nsubmitter expresses reservations about closing the report prior to a final \\nresolution, those concerns should be noted. If the filer provides additional \\ninformation that is pertinent to the report, it should not be closed until those \\nconcerns are addressed. If no new information is brought forward, the report \\nshould be closed.\\nc. Closing Notification\\n1) Once the report is closed, the Safety Representative should send the submitter an \\nemail summarizing the review. Findings, recommendations, and actions generated \\nby the review should be identified. The email should address any findings the Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 77}),\n",

Irregularity reporting programs are in place for each operating division at the Company \\nallowing employees and business partners to report operational irregularities, safety \\nconcerns, close calls, or incidents.\\n2. Irregularity reports are submitted and processed via the AAG Safety Reporting System. It \\nmay be necessary to create a report if information is provided outside of the AAG Safety \\nReporting System (hotline, email, conversation, etc.).\\n3. Requirements and specific procedures for the submission and processing of irregularity \\nreports are established by the operating divisions and are documented within divisional \\nmanuals.\\nB. Responsibilities\\n1. Each operating division will designate an employee(s) who is responsible for managing \\nincoming irregularity reports. This person (or designee) views all newly submitted \\nirregularity reports for their division, ensure proper documentation of event categorization, \\nEvent Level, required actions, and notifies appropriate points of contact for internal and \\ncross-divisional follow-up. \\n2. Each analyst is responsible for processing irregularity reports and escalating, as necessary, \\nby flagging the event for an investigation and/or to be documented/discussed at the \\nfollowing meetings: WSR, OPL, and/or DAG/SRB.Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 78}),\n",

Irregularity reports are critical in providing visibility to hazards in the operation. It is \\nimportant for these reports to be reviewed and processed in as timely a manner as possible. \\nAll reports shall be read within three calendar days of receipt. The following reports should \\nbe immediately evented once read and given an initial Event Level:\\na. Event Level C-F\\nb. Events that require an investigation\\nc. Events that are flagged for discussion at WSR and/or OPL\\n2. Reports received on the weekend that meet the above criteria should be processed before \\nWSR, or by Tuesday at noon following a Monday holiday. In the event that we have not \\nreceived a report for a known event, the analyst and/or Safety Manager will brief the content \\nof the event at WSR.\\n3. All other reports should be evented in a timely fashion, ensuring at a minimum that enough \\ntime is given to prepare content and do proper data analysis prior to the corresponding DAG \\nand SRB.\\nD. Irregularity Report Processing Procedures\\n1. Employee or business partner submits report via the AAG Safety Reporting System or \\ninforms station leadership of an event for submission into the system, which is automatically \\nfiltered to the appropriate division for review.\\n2. The analyst will review the report and generate an event, to include:\\na. Correct documentation of all pertinent information\\nb. A summary of the event\\nc. Assignment of an Event Level based on the AAG SMS Matrix\\nd. Flagging for WSR, Close Call, OPL, investigations, DAG/SRB (as applicable)\\nNOTE\\nElevating events to the appropriate management review is based on criteria \\ndocumented in Chapter 9.13\\ne.

If the analyst is unsure about an Event Level, they may leave the Event Level unassigned \\nand contact the applicable Safety Manager/Director for assistance or if applicable, flag it for \\nWSR to be assessed cross-divisionally.\\n5. If the report was submitted to the wrong division or needs further action from outside the \\ndivision (e.g., Security, Environmental, Catering, Fueling, etc.), the report will be sent to the \\nappropriate division for actioning and/or awareness.\\n6. Investigation criteria is based on the division specific Event Response Matrix (ERM) as \\ndocumented in Appendix B. If an investigation is needed, the analyst will check the \\ninvestigation check-box in the event and follow the notification guidelines documented in \\nthe division specific Event Response Matrix. After the investigation process has concluded, \\nthe Event Level may be updated to reflect new information, as applicable.\\n7. Analysts should flag the following types of events for discussion at the applicable meeting:\\na. WSR:\\n1) Event that warrants cross-divisional discussion, not just cross-divisional action\\n2) Close call events\\n3) A4A reportable damage\\n4) Events with an Event Level C-F\\n5) Events that warrant a Safety or Division led investigation (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)\\nb.

Close Call Processing Procedures\\n1. A close call is defined as an unplanned event that did not result in an injury, illness, incident, \\ndamage, or accident - but had the potential to do so. Only a fortunate break in the chain of \\nevents prevented a negative outcome. Often the words “luck” or “exceptional skill” are said \\nto be the only barrier remaining. AAG defines a Close Call where the worst credible \\noutcome could have resulted in:\\na. Employee injury (Event Level C-F)\\nb. Aircraft damage (Event Level C-F)\\nc. Property damage (Event Level C-F)\\nd. Regulatory noncompliance (Event Level C-F)\\n2. It is essential to review Close Call events as if the worst credible outcome had occurred. In \\nthese events, little to no safety margin remains and the only elements protecting against a \\nnegative outcome is “luck” or “exceptional skill”. The following general Close Call process \\napplies:\\na. Employee submits a safety report which is filtered to the appropriate division for review.\\nb. Analyst reviews the report and generates an event without assigning an Event Level.\\nc. Analyst will immediately contact their SMS Liaison and the appropriate Safety director \\nor manager to trigger an investigation. An investigation will occur by either the \\noperating division or the Safety division.\\nd. Close Call events from the previous week will be reviewed at P-WSR. Events that do \\nnot have a completed investigation will be assigned an initial Event Level given current \\nknown information.\\ne. Close Call events will be briefed at WSR, SPL, OPL, DAG, and SRB, as applicable.\\nf. After the investigation has concluded, the Event Level will be updated, as applicable.\\ng. All Close Call events will be given a System Assessment at P-WSR, WSR, and/or SPL \\nmeetings once the investigation has concluded.\\nh. If the investigation identifies a new hazard, ineffective risk control, or change to policy / \\nprocedures, a reactive SRA will be conducted. If the investigation discovers non-\\ncompliance and/or non-conformance, a corrective/preventive action will be issued.\\ni. Close Call events will be reviewed and tracked at the respective DAG(s)/SRB(s) until \\nall actions are complete.\\nF. Irregularity Report Examples\\n1.

The Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) is a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \\nsponsored program designed to collect safety related information from employees and use \\nthat information to develop corrective/preventive actions to enhance safety. ASAP utilizes \\nnon-punitive incentives to encourage safety event reporting that may otherwise go \\nunreported. This allows corrective actions to be implemented to enhance safety within the \\noperation.\\n2. AAG currently hosts ASAP programs for Pilots, Flight Attendants, Dispatchers, \\nMaintenance Management and Maintenance Technicians. Alaska Airlines Airport \\nOperations employees with union representation (Customer Service, Ramp, Cargo, \\nOperations, Stores Agents, Crew Scheduling, Reservations, Accounting, and Records \\nSpecialists) are covered by the Ground Safety Action Program (GSAP), which has the same \\nrequirements of the ASAP Program. Each program is governed by a Memorandum of \\nUnderstanding (MOU) agreed to by the representatives of the FAA, the Company, and \\nemployee union (where applicable).\\n3. The ASAP program relies on the understanding and cooperation between the parties \\ninvolved to function successfully. The MOU is the controlling document for the program and \\nhouses the standard operating procedures (SOP) for the workgroups. FAA guidance for \\nASAP is contained in Advisory Circular 120-66 (as amended), the FAA ASAP website, and \\ndirectly from AFS-280.\\n4. All ASAP programs are administered by the AAG Safety Division, and specifically by ASAP \\nSpecialists and Managers, with the assistance of the SMS Managers (as applicable); this \\nestablishes the ASAP Team. The team reports directly to the General Manager SMS and \\nASAP, who has overall authority of the program.\\n5. There are times when an ASAP report and a voluntary disclosure (VDRP) are submitted to \\nthe FAA specific to a singular event. Confidentiality will be maintained to ensure trust in the Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 82}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='14 of 32\\nChapter 9Safety Management System Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nASAP program remains intact. Refer to the AAG Safety Manual Section 5.3: “Voluntary \\nDisclosure Reporting Program (VDRP)” for details of the program.\\nB. Submitting ASAP Reports\\n1. ASAP is a voluntary program and reports are never required; however, reporting is highly \\nrecommended whenever an employee believes that they may have violated a Federal \\nAviation Regulation (FAR), Federal or State regulations, Company policy or procedure, or \\nanything related to the safety of the operation. Employees may also submit ASAP reports to \\nhighlight observed safety concerns.\\n2. Accepted ASAP reports guarantee that, in the event of an FAR violation, no FAA \\nenforcement action will be taken. Accepted ASAP reports also cannot be used by the \\nCompany to initiate or support any company discipline. The vast majority of reports are \\naccepted.\\n3. An ASAP report does not substitute for a required irregularity report (MIR, PIR, GIR, FAIR, \\netc.). In some cases, two reports may be necessary to meet both the Company’s reporting \\nrequirements and to take advantage of the protective provisions of ASAP.\\n4. All reports are submitted electronically, via the AAG Safety Reporting System, and each \\nindividual involved in the event must report separately. Links to the AAG Safety pages, for \\nthe respective companies, are located at:\\na. Alaska Airlines - AlaskasWorld.com\\nb. Horizon Air - OnYourHorizon.com\\nC. Report Acceptance\\n1. Report acceptance policy is defined in the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU 10 \\n(1) and (2)).\\na. The Big Five:\\n1) Criminal activity\\n2) Substance abuse\\n3) Controlled substances\\n4) Alcohol\\n5) Intentional falsification\\nb. Additional considerations for acceptance include, timeliness of reporting, repeat non-\\ncompliance, non-compliance with Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and \\nreports of an employee acting outside the scope of their employment.\\nD. ASAP Process\\n1. For the purposes of this section, the ASAP Facilitator is the member of the ASAP Team who \\nfacilitates the operating divisions’ Event Review Committee (ERC).Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 83}),\n",

A submitter may contact \\nthe ASAP Hotline to ensure timely reporting of an event and follow-up with a formal report \\nsubmission accordingly.\\na. ASAP Hotline: 1-877-897-2727\\n3. The ASAP Facilitator receives the report, links it with other reports concerning the same \\nevent (if applicable), and edits the event type and applicable attributes, as necessary. The \\nASAP Facilitator can begin researching and gathering related details on the event (log \\npages, schedules, corresponding irregularity reports, company related investigation), and \\nprovide that information to the ERC members. The ASAP Facilitator also places the event \\non the agenda for the next ERC meeting.\\n4. ERC members review the events, including related details gathered by the ASAP Facilitator \\nprior to the meeting, and can comment on it using the review process in the AAG Safety \\nReporting System.\\n5. The ERC meets and reviews the events together and comes to a voluntary agreement of all \\nrepresentatives to determine event disposition in the following areas:\\na. Status\\nb. Acceptance\\nc.

The ASAP Facilitator records the meeting minutes, advises the submitter of the status of the \\nreport, updates management on status of report (if requested), updates the database with \\nthe report status, documents applicable actions, assigns an owner, then forwards \\nassignments and tracks them to completion.\\n8. Annually, the ERC reviews its corrective action recommendations for effectiveness and \\nmakes further recommendations if necessary.\\nE. Event Review Committee (ERC)\\n1. ERC members consist of a primary and alternate person from the FAA, Company, and \\nemployee union representative (if appropriate). All ERC members shall be selected and \\ndesignated in writing (email acceptable) by the workgroup represented. Only the primary or \\nalternate are required to attend ERC meetings, but both can attend.\\n2. A member of the ASAP Team facilitates each ERC meeting, but is not a voting member of \\nthe ERC.\\n3. Event reports will be made available to the ERC through the AAG Safety Reporting System \\nas soon as the ASAP Team reads and processes the report.\\n4. Prior to the first meeting at which at event is discussed, the FAA ERC member is \\nresponsible for determining whether there is previous FAA knowledge of the event outside \\nof the event report. This allows for prompt, sole-source, determination. \\n5. ERC members are responsible for reviewing the reports prior to the meeting and are \\nencouraged to use the ERC Review option in the AAG Safety Reporting System to forward \\nany requests for additional information or to identify they would like an investigation \\nconducted.\\nNOTE\\nThe ERC can also be assigned the responsibility of conducting an investigation within an \\nassociated Irregularity Report.\\n6. The ERC will make corrective/preventive action recommendations to the Company based \\nupon individual events or concerning trends. Examples of company corrective/preventive \\nactions can include, but are not limited to, procedure changes, manual changes, bulletins, \\netc.\\n7. The ERC can recommend corrective/preventive actions to the submitting employee if \\ndeemed appropriate. Examples of corrective/preventive actions for an employee include \\ncoaching, training, or briefing. Other methods may be administered if agreed upon by the \\nERC.\\n8. ERC members can request contact and interview the submitter of an ASAP report.\\nF.

Information on Employee Injury Reporting can be found in the 6.2.18 of the AAG Safety Manual.\\n9.8 Analysis of Data (§5.71(b))\\nA. Analysis involves the examination of data acquired from the sources listed in this section to \\nmake decisions about safety performance of the operation and of the SMS. It is important to use \\nthe data available to look across these various sources for trends to learn from the information \\navailable. This is important to determine the scope of a potential hazard or ineffective control. A \\nhazard found at one location could be isolated, or it could be in place at other locations, a region, \\nor the entire system. This information will help determine the likelihood associated with a \\npotential outcome.\\nB. The data described in Section 9.1  through Section 9.7 , also summarized below, will be used to \\nassess the performance and effectiveness of operational procedures, safety risk controls and \\nthe SMS to identify root cause of non-conformance and to identify new or potential hazards. This \\ninformation will be used to identify opportunities for improvement. Each division will use the \\ninputs from the list below that are applicable to their operation. Minimum elements for each \\noperation division are listed in bold.\\n1. Voluntary reports: Safety Hazard Reports (SHRs), ASAP, Safety hotline calls (§5.71(a)(7)), \\nVoluntary Self Disclosures (VDRPs)\\n2. Mandatory safety irregularity reports (§5.71(a)(7))\\n3.

DAG, SRB and ESRB documentation \\nwill serve as the primary system for assessment and decision documentation. It is the \\nresponsibility of each division to store the SA output (DAGs and SRBs) in the Safety_SMS_SA \\nnetwork folder upon completion of each meeting, that SMS actions are documented, and that all \\nrecords are maintained and stored in accordance with Section 7.8  of this manual (§5.73(b)).\\n9.10 Management of Change (§5.73(a)(2)-(5) & (b))\\nA. Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air has developed “triggers”, based on the FAA SMS guidance, to \\nidentify planned changes within the organization and operation that have potential to affect \\nprocedures and the operation. The modifications include the items listed in Section 8.3 . \\nDivisional and corporate management reviews provide a venue to channel identified risks along \\nwith existing change management procedures. The Risk Register will be used to document and \\ntrack safety risks identified during changes or modifications to the operational processes within \\nthe organization.\\n9.11 Corrective/Preventive Action (§5.75)\\nA. This process is used to address existing or potential non-conformity with risk controls that are \\nconsidered to be effective per the system assessment. Corrective/preventive action or SRM will \\nbe conducted in response to investigation results, as needed. These actions are developed, \\nprioritized, and implemented within a timely manner to minimize accidents, incidents and non-\\ncompliance. (Refer to Section 9.9  and Figure 9- 2 – SMS Decisions, for more information).\\nB. Corrective action will be used to correct identified nonconformity with effective risk controls or \\nprocedures.\\nC. Preventive action will be used to address potential nonconformity with effective risk controls or \\nprocedures.\\nRev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 90}),\n",

Corrective/Preventive Action is used to get well-designed or effective controls back on track. As \\nan example, if required training was not completed, the corrective/preventive action would be to \\nprioritize completion. If a procedure was well-developed, but was not well-implemented in the \\noperation, it would be necessary to ensure implementation. If the training had not been well-\\ndeveloped to provide necessary guidance, or if the procedure was not effective, SRM would be \\nneeded instead of Corrective/Preventive Action.\\nE. Lessons learned during the investigation, analysis and system assessment process will be \\nconsidered when developing corrective or preventive action. The lessons learned can provide \\nvaluable insight across the organization that will help explain the ‘why’ to affected employees, \\nshow the company’s dedication to safety and commitment to improvement, and will share an \\nexample of the SMS at work.\\nF. Outputs of this process are documented within the Safety Reporting System, and in the safety \\nnetwork folders for each department, (DAG, SRB, ESRB documentation). If additional sources \\nare used by divisions to store corrective/preventive action details, the division will indicate the \\nsource and location in divisional SMS documentation. Corrective/Preventive action \\ndocumentation will indicate what is being done, who is responsible for the action and when it will \\nbe completed.\\n9.12 Continuous Improvement (§5.75)\\nA. Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air will continuously improve the effectiveness of the SMS and of \\nsafety risk controls through the Safety Policy and its objectives; quality assurance objectives; \\nand investigations; data collected, analyzed and assessed per Section 9.8  and Section 9.9 ; and \\ncorrective/preventive actions and management reviews.\\nB.

Responsibility and Authority\\n1. The VP, Safety and Security is accountable for the implementation and quality of the safety \\ninvestigation policy. The VP, Safety and Security and Divisional VPs are ultimately \\nresponsible for determining if an accident or incident investigation will be conducted and \\nwho will lead the investigation.\\n2. The MD, Safety Assurance (AS) and MD, Safety (QX) are responsible for the maintenance \\nand revision control of the Alaska Air Group1 (AAG) Safety & Compliance Investigation \\nProcess, which follows AC 120-92, as amended, 14 CFR 5.71(a)(6). These parties are \\nresponsible for tracking all investigations to completion. \\n3. The MD, Safety Assurance (AS) and MD, Safety (QX) have the authority to coordinate with \\nSafety and operating division leadership to ensure investigation assignment has been \\ndetermined. \\n4. The 119 Director of Safety (AS/QX respectively) is responsible for communicating to the \\nNTSB anytime there is an event that falls under 49 CFR Part 830. \\n5. The Manager Business Intelligence Safety (or designee) is responsible for maintaining \\naccess to the AAG Safety Reporting System permissions. \\nB. Investigation Policy\\n1. The purpose of conducting an accident/incident/non-compliance investigation is to \\ndetermine the event’s root cause, contributing factors, and make safety recommendations \\nso that corrective/preventive action(s) may be taken to prevent recurrence. If the \\ninvestigation identifies an ineffective risk control, new hazard, or requires a change in \\npolicy/procedure/process, SRM will be conducted. \\n2. All incidents and accidents will be investigated in accordance with the AAG ERG or \\napplicable operating division Event Response Matrix (ERM). Operating division personnel \\nare responsible for notifying Safety of events that trigger an investigation and may be \\ntasked to either assist in the investigation, or in certain cases, perform a full investigation as \\noutlined in the ERMs.\\n3. The division specific ERM defines who is responsible for each aspect of the investigation \\nand the respective outputs. At a minimum, investigators will have a technical background2 \\nin the area they are investigating and will have been trained in SMS Awareness. \\n1.Throughout this document, use of the term “The Company” represents Alaska Air Group.\\n2.For the purpose of this document, a technical background refers to someone who has experience operating in\\nthe process, auditing the process, acting in a compliance role over the process, or equivalent experience.Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 113}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2 of 10\\nAppendix BSafety Management System Manual\\nUncontrolled copy when downloaded or printed from an electronic document.\\nNOTE\\nIf the event is identified only via an ASAP report or FOQA data, the investigation will be \\nrun through those applicable workstreams.\\n4. Investigations that require a drug test shall follow procedures outlined in the Drug and \\nAlcohol Policy.\\n5. Investigation output(s), as outlined in the division specific ERM, will be entered into the AAG \\nSafety Reporting System and discussed at P-WSR, WSR, SPL, OPL, DAG, SRB, and/or \\nESRB (as applicable) for resolution and tracking.\\n6. All investigation actions will be reviewed by the applicable Safety Manager (or designee) to \\nensure management commitments and mitigations (as applicable) are completed prior to \\nbeing closed in the AAG Safety Reporting System database. \\n7. Accident and incident investigations will be maintained not less than five years and in \\naccordance with applicable regulatory requirements.\\nC. Training\\n1. The Safety Directors will facilitate training to Safety individuals who will be conducting any \\nSafety led investigation as defined in the division specific ERM. Training should take place \\nprior to conducting an investigation. All individuals involved in Safety led investigations will \\nalso be trained in Safety Assurance, Risk Acceptance, and/or Safety Risk Management as \\noutlined in 10.2.2. Operational divisions are responsible for training their investigation \\nprocess for all other investigations. \\n2. There are several tools to arrive at root cause and causal factors (TapRoot, Bow Tie, \\nMEDA, etc); however, the purpose of this manual is not to prescribe one over the other. It is \\nthe responsibility of the operating divisions to understand their needs, and determine which \\ntool works best for them.\\nD. Investigation Procedure\\n1. As soon as there is an incident, the operating division shall utilize Ready, Safe, Go, and \\ntake immediate action to stop the unsafe condition and prevent it from reoccurring. \\na. Notification - Early notification is essential to initiate and organize the investigation. \\nInitial information concerning the facts and circumstances of the occurrence will often \\nbe incomplete and erroneous. For this reason, early factual information transmitted for \\nalerting purposes must be handled with considerable discretion. Parties notified are to \\nbe cautioned about the preliminary nature of the data. Initial notification will usually be \\nthrough the Company’s internal notification system, which sends short messages via \\ntext message and email. The following will be included in the message (if applicable):\\n1) The carrier (Alaska, Horizon, CPA)\\n2) Title of the event (illness, laser strike, injury, etc.)\\n3) Flight number\\n4) City pairingRev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 114}),\n",

When an event occurs that triggers a Division led investigation, the division will work with \\nthe applicable Safety Director/Manager to discuss via the fastest means available (in-\\nperson, phone, text message) their initial understanding of the incident, and determine who \\nwill conduct the investigation.\\nNOTE\\nFor Division led events that are cross-divisional in nature, the group that is most greatly \\naffected (as determined through a conversation with the appropriate divisional leaders and \\nSafety) is responsible for conducting the investigation.\\n3. The Investigator in Charge (IIC) (Safety/Division/ASAP/FOQA) shall be documented in the \\naccompanying Irregularity Report (if applicable)\\nNOTE\\nIf an event has both an Irregularity Report and a confidential report submitted under an \\nASAP program, the investigation will be coordinated appropriately to ensure ASAP \\nprotections are kept, while also maintaining the investigation process to address relevant \\nsafety concerns.\\n4.

Event Description: “What happened?”\\nFigure B-1: Evidence Collection\\nB. The initial steps for the individual conducting the investigation is to clearly understand the \\nsequence of events that occurred prior to the incident. It is important during this phase for the \\ninvestigator to focus on attaining and documenting as much evidence as possible. The analysis \\nof the data will happen later in the process. \\n1. Written evidence may include (but is not limited to) any of the following sources:\\na. TRAX reports for recent repair orders relevant to the area involved in the incident\\nb. Dispatch release for the incident flight\\nc. Training records of the personnel involved in the incident\\nd. Irregularity report(s) (IR) from any applicable division for the incident\\ne. Witness statements (when other formal reports are unavailable)\\n2. For damage events, to the maximum extent possible, the investigator, leadership, or \\nemployees on the scene should photograph the damaged equipment and the surrounding \\narea, as applicable. If operational commitments demand the scene of the incident be \\ndisturbed, individuals shall photograph as much of the scene as possible before it is altered. \\nObtain Written \\nevidence \\nx TRAX\\nx Dispatch Release\\nx Traini ng re cords\\nx GIR \\nx Pilot Report \\nx Flight Attendant \\nReport \\nx Wi tnes s statem en ts \\nPhotogra ph da mag e \\n(if a pplicable) \\nx Provide scale \\nx Provide multiple \\nangles  \\nObtain Video Evidence \\n(if available and / or \\napplicable)  \\nConduct interview(s)Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 116}),\n",

Video surveillance1 is another method of identifying what happened for most ground \\nincidents; however, investigators shall not use it as the sole means for an investigation. \\nVideo cameras have a limited field of view and do not always account for all the critical \\nbreakdowns of an incident. Consider the use of video as a supplementary data point to the \\ninvestigation.\\n4. Attention should be given to preserve time-sensitive evidence, ensuring employee debriefs \\nare conducted as soon as possible. During the initial interviews, the investigator should \\nencourage the interviewee to provide a clear description of what actually happened prior to \\nthe incident, rather than an account of what should have happened. The interviewee should \\nprovide a written statement of events in the AAG Safety Reporting System in addition to the \\nverbal debrief. In the event this is not feasible it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure \\naccuracy in the facts and details of the event.\\n5. In all cases, the individual leading the investigation will share the initial understanding of the \\nfacts with their respective divisional leadership and the applicable Safety Director (or \\ndesignee) as outlined in the division specific ERM. This includes ensuring the proper \\nnotifications are made as necessary:\\na. FAA notification\\nb. NTSB notification\\nc. Quarantine the flight data recorder\\nd. Quarantine the cockpit voice recorder\\nC. Identify Root Cause and Causal Factors\\n1. For operational investigations, the investigator will coordinate with operational SMEs to \\nconsider the relationship between the Human, Medium, Machine, and Management and \\nthen determine how these relationships created the causal factors that led to the control \\nbreakdown(s). Below is a diagram demonstrating the dependencies between the above \\ncategories; at the center is the “mission” – in this instance, the “mission” is the safe \\ncompletion of operational processes.\\na. There are several tools to arrive at root cause and causal factors (TapRoot, Bow Tie, \\nMEDA, etc); however, the purpose of this manual is not to prescribe one over the other. \\nIt is the responsibility of the operating divisions to understand their needs, and \\ndetermine which tool works best for them.\\nNOTE\\nThe investigator should call out which root cause methodology they used along with a \\nstandardized root cause taxonomy.\\n1.The Manager of Corporate Security may be able to provide video evidence.Rev. 18\\n6/16/2023', metadata={'source': 'Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air SMS Manual.pdf', 'page': 117}),\n",

Particular focus should \\nbe given toward understanding any human error that may have occurred. \\nConsider, but do not limit yourself to the following:\\ni. Does the individual’s 72-hour history suggest little sleep, or less sleep \\nthan usual?\\nii. Did the accident occur during times of reduced alertness (such as 0300 \\nto 0500)?\\niii. Had the individual been awake for a long time at the time of the accident?\\niv. Does the evidence suggest that the accident was a result of inaction or \\ninattention on the part of the individual?\\nv. Does the individual understand the process / policy?\\nvi.

Were the operators of the equipment adequately trained to operate the \\nmachine?\\n3) Medium\\na) This area includes the conditions under which the other actions take place. \\nThis area may include the weather at the time the actions were taken and \\nwhether the actions took place during daylight or during periods of darkness. \\nIf the incident occurred in-flight, these may include whether the flight was in \\nvisual meteorological conditions or operating under instrument conditions. \\nAdditionally, consider the adequacy of artificial enhancements aimed at \\nimproving the working conditions. Consider, but do not limit yourself to the \\nfollowing:\\ni. Was there adequate lighting in place?\\nii. Was there adequate protection from the elements?\\niii. Would this incident have taken place if the conditions were moderate \\ntemperatures with clear and unrestricted visibility?\\n4) Management\\na) The Company’s management administers the elements that make up the \\ncontrols for all the factors discussed above. Controls are the policies and \\nstandards that aim to minimize the risk of incidents occurring. The investigator \\nshould think critically about management’s need to balance operational \\nperformance and the rigidity of the control environment.\\nb) Management issues external to the Company should also be considered. In \\nsome cases, industry or government oversight organizations which issue, \\ncontrol, and/or monitor operating certificates have their own influence on the \\nway an incident occurs.\\n5) Mission\\na) The type of mission or the purpose of the operation is also considered \\nimportant during the investigation process. This is because each risk is \\nassociated with different types of operation which do vary. For example, “Is \\nthe mission/procedure too ambitious that it could not be achieved?” Each \\nmission being different will have certain intrinsic hazards that are accepted \\nwith the type of mission.\\nD. SRM\\n1. When the investigation concludes that any of the SRM triggers have been met (most likely \\nan ineffective risk control or a new hazard), a qualified SRM Facilitator will perform an SRA.\\nE.
